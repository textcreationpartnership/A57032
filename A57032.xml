            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Did not expect after I had given some Men the pleasure of fancying themselves Victors, that they would have expos'd me to the sorry Condition of Captives taken in War, and prolong'd their Revenge beyond the day of Battel: But their Charity like the Pestilence, which walks in darkness, does spend its Arrows in private, and we have new Billets of defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to try if we dare run the hazard of another Encounter. Our Authors, I believe, jugde it to be a great part of Manhood to offer a Challenge, and acquaint us they are ready for the Combat, and yet like Champions in Armor conceal their Persons; but I fancy 'tis no disadvantage to their Reputations to be unknown to the World, who though they pretend to the Authority of instructing others, have not, I fear, pursued the old Philosophers Advice of Knowing themselves.</p>
            <p>They have made an Out-cry in the Nation, that the <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire</hi> Grand Jury Signed a very dangerous Petition, and that one of the Subscribers presum'd to second it with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. Nor has there been wanting the assistance of able Wits to represent both as the product of evil and disloyal Men: But the Mischief is, they have expected an Answer, and an Answer they have not receiv'd, by which means they have lost the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of shewing their Parts, and the <hi>Pelean</hi> Youths grieve they have no more Worlds to conquer; but being uneasie in an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive station, and fearing their Pensions, Popular Applause I mean, and the other private Courtesies of their friends, may be withdrawn when their labour is over, they provoke us all they can to afford them fresh occasion of dispute. In order to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other Tricks, they have compos'd a new Reply, and sending it in Manuscript, written with several Hands, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd with the many singular Embellishments of Spleen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, which a Club of envious Men could suppose agreeable to
<pb facs="tcp:36597:4"/> the Religion they profess to our former High Sheriff Mr. <hi>W. D.</hi> to be convey'd to me, I accordingly receiv'd it, at which time I could not but express my resentment, That poor School-boys should be rob'd of such choice Materials as might have serv'd to the use of their Paper-kites; I have little to say of the Authors of that Manuscript, or their Arguments, which render in Epitome the goodly stuff that others had more Elaborately penn'd: And did I know their Persons, I should be loth to engage in a correspondence which would make the Dispute as uncertain as their Address: But since they admire, I had not reply'd to the Reflector, and to the Examiner of the Suspended Bishops Case, and seem, though against Christian Peace and Charity, if they think they are in the right, to dare me to it, I shall once for all consider the loud pretences of those men who have openly attacked us with such spight and calumny: And truly 'tis pity those Gentlemen should not be in some sort satisfied; for they will otherwise be apt to think that their learned Composures are strangely slighted by the World.</p>
            <p>However, as the Regulation his Majesty hath been pleased to make in the Hierarchy, together with an Inclination to Peace, hath enduc'd me, tho against the wills of some men thus long to bear with silence the noise of their Triumph, so shall I for the same Reasons decline in the ensuing Discourse from entring farther into the Merit of our Petition, than briefly to explain its Design. And yet if our Authors are so free as to allow us the Liberty to reflect and examin as well as themselves, I doubt not but I shall find Materials enough out of their own Words to condemn them, and to prove that they have exceeded the just Boundaries of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of Truth and of Common Honesty.</p>

               <p>IT is no Surprise that our Examiner, to dispose unwary men to purchase his Book, should dawb the Pillars and the Gates of our Churches, and presume to affix the Titles of his Libel there, when he had with the same unhallowed hands, thrown his dirt into the Temple it self: For at the very time that he pretends to represent Truth to us, he joyns her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his own Profaneness; and thinks it no breach, either of Law, or of Gospel, to plead unrighteously for God. If he had not given us the Honour of knowing he is a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from whom Car-mens Railery, and other lewd Language could not reasonably have been expected, we might have thought him one of the Family of the Old <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ward blackness.</p>
               <p>I am sure he never learn't his Theatrical Dialect from the Holy Apostles, to whose Directions, Clergymen (of all others) are more especially obliged: No instruction without the Spirit of Meekness; no Uncharitable Surmise, or false Accusation do's bear a part on the Sacred File; and therefore I know not how our New-stampt Clergy-man can reconcile a continued Series of Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght and Malice, that abounds in his Pamphlet with such serious Texts, unless he first place deformed Envy among the Christian Graces.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36597:5"/>
               <p>In truth, he seems rather to have practis'd according to the prescriptions of <hi>Galen,</hi> than to the Rules of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the Physical Dose did such Violence to him, that 'tis no wonder he complain'd in one of his Pages, that he was weary of the Operation; for after a full Vomit, his Malady fell downwards; and I fear the Jallap left him in no good Case.</p>
               <p>Our other Author, who has oblig'd the Age with his Reflections, did I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, pretend great Friendship and good Humor: But in bestowing the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy, he usually interlaced some Digressions; which, as they betray'd the genuine temper of his mind, so did they discover him to be not altogether exempt from the frailty of being inveterate.</p>
               <p>Nor was he content to confine his passions within the compass of his Book; but we find a Golden Legend, <hi>à tergo Scripta,</hi> where he delivers matters of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial Moment: For instead of an Advertisement, to discover what Lap-dogs are lost, what Canary-Birds are lately Arrived, or what other Pamphlets the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Authors of the Modest Enquiry, and their Brethren of the Quill have put forth for Ghostly Instruction (this being a Customary supply to Mercurial Writers, when their Stock of Fancy is Exhausted) he hath by the grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Publisher recommended a Postscript to us, that resolves it self into the following Interpretation (1.) That Gentlemen (tho it seems to be of hard Digestion to him) usually serve upon Grand-juries (2.) That as no Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was the Author of the Address, so neither of the Apology (3.) That he himself, if he be a Gentleman, is none of the best Christians, being guilty of that very Scurrility, which he pretends to Condemn in others. He tells me, that some particular passages in the Apology, which toucht the Rampant Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Barbarous Regicides and of other Bloody and Hypocritical Men, were the product of my own evil self, and not of the Spirit of God, who is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Peace. This Lecture was, I confess, an home-push, and I thought at first sight, it would have brought me to the Reflecters stool of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But after I had duly considered the Charge, I had no reason to be Surprised at the Malevolence of the Censure, especially since our Reflecter, to represent me as an ill Man, has thought it advisable to Rob an Old Popish Author of a Canting Expression. For <hi>Cochloeus</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Wormacian Dyet,</hi> in which he represents the best Men as the Enemies of God, tells them, That <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> to whose singular qualifications, neither the Reflecter nor my self, must dare to pretend, was guided <hi>fraude sui Spiritus qui utique non pacis sed diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntionis esse solebat, &amp;c.</hi> I would desire our Author, if not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the impertinence of that unchristian Allegation, with the Stuff he has published against me, yet at least to reflect on his own hard words; and so I proceed to consider the exceptions which our two Adversaries have laid down, not only against the proceedings of our Grand-jury, but against the Doctrine of Humanity, and the Discipline of our Church; against all our Bishops in general, and the Sentiments of our best Doctors, who have with due Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, comply'd with the late Oaths. I shall begin with their unfair dealing with us, which is at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ended with so many spightful Remarks, such jealousies and foul suspicious, that I believe the Authors had a mind to set up for none of the honestest or best natur'd Men in the World. And though it may be in vain to offer them a Remedy to Cure their prejudice; Yet I shall endeavour to prevent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he inveterate disease from infecting others.</p>
               <p>In the first place, I am obliged to inform you, that every person save one of our Grand-jury, signed the Address, and that no disrespectful words passed between the Dissenters and us: For as the Honourable Judge was pleas'd on all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36597:5"/> occasions to distinguish us from Common Tipstaves, and the other inferior At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Court, with a Title to which the Publisher of the Reflections cannot (without some Mortification to his grinning Modesty) be reconcil'd; so were we very sensible of the import of that name, and have entertain'd a generous Opinion of our Brother. Nor could I observe he then decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Resentment of us. If he has at his leisure acted in a different strain▪ I am sure we gave him no just occasion to be uncharitable. I have one thing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which manifested our Agreement in a main point, and prov'd our resolv'd concurrence against our Common Enemy: For our Presentment, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch we lodg'd in the Court, as it pass'd by our General Vote; so were it Transcrib'd by other Grand-juries, and manag'd with prudence, and pursued with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, it would soon discover the private recesses of Jesuits, and disappoint the frequency of their Cabals.</p>
               <p>I must in this place, beg leave to remind the Reflecter of a wilful mistake of his; which as it is a Treacherous Imposing on his Reader, so I shall in a few words discover the pleasant Transport he gives out in his Title page, That his Book contains a Vindication of those who refused to Subscribe the Petition; this is a bold stroke, and the words imply, that a certain number refus'd: But how he could imagine that this could square with matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act, or gain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with serious Men, I know not; except we allow the Author to be a person of unaccountable Raptures, and amidst his extraordinary Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have retired from Reason and Sence.</p>
               <p>However, 'tis very diverting to consider with what Artifice he do's improve this fond Conceit in several pages of his Pamphlet; for although in truth all Persons (the one Dissenting Grand-jury-man excepted) who pretend to the Name of Non-Subscribers, were as Remote from that concern, as a Lapland Priest, or the King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> yet the Reflecter makes a great noise and pudder about the Non-Subscribers; and having beat his Cushion for Voluntiers, he sets up a Banner, under which he endeavours to list all new-comers into that Glorious Character.</p>
               <p>If by his Vindication of those that refus'd to Subscribe the Petition, he had not meant them that oppos'd, and made an Outcry against it, he might have sav'd his pains: For mere Refusers were never Censured by us; and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate those who are not charg'd with any thing, may be thought the part of one who hath nothing to do, but would rather make mischief, than not find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self business.</p>
               <p>A grand Reason our Author is pleased to alledge for the Refusers Non-Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is [<hi>Pag.</hi> 19.] that they must become Sureties, when the parties themselves will not come into Bond: This is a lofty flight of words that are wide of the mark. But indeed, though the Subscribers were all satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d with their own Act and Deed; Yet it would have bin a great weakness in any of them, to have Sollicited such as he to subscribe, or become Suretie, for their Diocesan: This had bin <hi>Ovem lupo commitiere;</hi> so should St. <hi>Paul</hi> have desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed or chosen <hi>Tertulius</hi> his malicious Accuser, to have chang'd his Note, and have pleaded for him, or become his Surety; any one would have concluded he had bin weary, both of his Reputation and his Life.</p>
               <p>But truly the Reflecter notwithstanding his Deep-reach, discovers his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: For he begs two questions, supposing 1. That the Subscribers propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves the Bishops Sureties, and 2. That they interceded for a favour to the Bishops, without their giving the Government any Security of their own; which is a strange implication, and is remote from the Language, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36597:6"/> design of our Address: 'Tis not to be doubted, but that some of the Fathers, if they had thought it necessary, could have produced such a List of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, Gownmen and Plebeians (Men true to the interests of the present Settlement) to have enter'd into Bond for them, as would have pall'd the rankest Reflecter: But as they never signified their desire, or their need of such Compurgators; so their Friends could not judge it a part of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give in their Names without Summons; nor would they have Subscribed, unless the Terms and the Conditions of the Favour had bin accepted: With which necessary performance, if either of the Non-jurors could not have closed his refusal together with his other Actions, do as little concern us, as the present argument him.</p>
               <p>Our Author enquires, why the Bishops had not Petitioned of themselves; but if it were lawful for the Bishops so to have done, what dangerous Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity could our Address for them be suppos'd to have carry'd in it? If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter thinks it unlawful for them to have Petit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oned, he has discovered his good Inclination; and we may safely say, That as <hi>Caesar</hi> had many <hi>Marius</hi>'s, so our Author seems to have abundance of Father <hi>Peter</hi>'s in him: But truly, the Advice which that Jesuit gave to King <hi>James,</hi> had such ill effect on our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the late Reign, that I believe, some of them who were then Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd for Petitioning, might be loath to be drawn through the River by the same Cat.</p>
               <p>We do not question his Majesties Clemency and Indulgence to humble Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants (he Conquers by his Mercy, as well as by his Sword) but yet it may be observ'd, that those Persons whose Consciences are satisfy'd by the favour of the New Indulgence, did not personally approach the Royal presence, or the Bars of the two Houses, to offer their Petitions or Arguments on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When our Author comes to Reflect on the Subscribers, he is not so posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive indeed, as to be a judge of a Grand-jury, and so waves their Character, by saying, it will not seem kind to distinguish them by any mark that carry's not Respect and Friendship with it: Yet he is not over-kind to some of them, having l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a Mark upon them, which he knows is not pleasing. Thus he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth; [<hi>Pag.</hi> 4.] some, saith he, of the Subscribers, are Persons of Worth and Loyalty to the Government, the rest have a particular Devotion for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> For what serves this Distinction, but to insinuate, that those who have a particular Devotion for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not Persons of Worth and Loyalty to the Government? Here his designs begin to appear, which he strenuously prosecutes, <hi>viz.</hi> To make all such suspected, as if they could not be good Subjects, and bear the World in Hand; that Fidelity to our National Church, and Loyalty to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were inconsistent.</p>
               <p>It may be observ'd what Art he do's use, to infuse jealousie into his Reader, when acknowledging there are the Names, he adds, it may be the Hands of such, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaving it doubtful, whether those Hands were really there or no: [<hi>Pag.</hi> 4.] So that a prejudic'd Reader may suspect some sly shuffling in this Case. But of what principles is the Reflecter, that can insinuate a Grand-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lies under Suspicion of forging Hands to a Petition? A Villainy fitter to be objected to the Out-casts of a Pillory, than to Persons of some Character and Repute in their Country. One might be tempted to think, that the Reflecter had practis'd a Modern way of getting Hands to Petitions, when Schoolmasters and Mistresses set down the Names of their Scholars, and Masters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys subscrib'd for all under their Roofs.</p>

And as I perused the Papers, which at a distance give us some light into the intreagues of that Age; I found out some, whom he places in the same Order with those <hi>Gloucester</hi> Gentlemen; and they are the Reverend Bishops, Doctors and Clergy-men of <hi>London,</hi> whose Names will be Famous in History, when out Examiner and his Book will be mouldred into Dust. I would entreat the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Reader, to Reflect with me on the Third Paragraph of the Address, which that Noble Prelate and his Clergy presented to the late King at his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crown, and then let him entertain what kind Opinion he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Examiner: Their words were these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Principles of our Church have taught us our Duty to our Prince, so we most humbly thank your Majesty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Gazett N. 2008.</note>
                  <hi>for making our Duty so easy and pleasant by your gracious Assurance, to defend our Religion Establisht by Law, which is dearer to us than our Lives; in a deep sense whereof we acknowledge our selves for ever bound, not only in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Gratitude to contribute all we can by our Prayers, our Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to your Majesties Happy and Prosperous Reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Language of one of our most Famous Prelates and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; this was the Concurring Sense of many other Bishops and Addressors of that time; and the like strain our Grand-juries Paper do's bear. I am sure none but an intriguing Faction, and their deluded Proselytes, who Addrest King <hi>James</hi> with thanks, for a Declaration that pointed at the ruine both of our Church and Government, can pretend to Condemn it. But do's the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer, who arrogates to himself the Title of a Clergy-man, dare, in this sort, to affront the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and his Clergy, because they Addrest for the Continuance and Support of our Religion?

'Tis pitty the great <hi>Compton,</hi> had not desired the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to have drawn up the Address, or at least to have beg'd his Pardon for the Error: But our Clergy-man is even with him; and tells the World, that the Bishop is Ridiculous: And I hope his Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But our Examiner will not let us pass without a further fling; for after he had according to his usual gravity considered our thanks to his Majesty, for his Resolution to grant a Pardon to his Subjects (which we need not blush to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36597:7"/> own was another Clause in our Address) he subjoyns a pretty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>A Man,</hi> (says he) <hi>would naturally infer, that our Grand Jury found themselves in need of a good Act of Indempnity,</hi> &amp;c. O the blessed Consequence! The Grand Jury Addrest his Majesty with thanks, for his Royal Favour to such as were lyable to the Penalties of the Law, and therefore they themselves needed a Pardon most. This Raillery was I suppose learnt from <hi>Celsus Julian,</hi> or some other profest Enemy of the Christian Religion; and if we admit the Argument to have any force, our Clergy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n may in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at the Coffee-House (where I guess he is more Conversant than at the Church) prescribe a New Alcoran, instead of the Bible, and without doubt may, among the Admirers of Novelty, gain many Proselytes; but by the Umpirage of Holy Writ, his supposition fails in a great point, Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there adjudg'd to be the infallible Badge of Innocency. And as no love could parallel that of our Saviour, and of the Holy <hi>Stephen;</hi> so did they (without partial Reservation) intercede with God for a gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al Mercy as to their Murtherers, so to the whole World: And will our Examiner affirm, that they themselves stood in need of a Pardon most? It is no wonder he throws his Invectives upon the Gentlemen of a Grand Jury, since by the Consequence of his presumptious Hypothesis, he spares not even the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jesus, nor his Renowned Proto-Martyr.</p>
               <p>I must with the Examiners leave retort the Argument upon his own head; for by his way of Reasoning, we may conclude, That because he has (to all appearance) been so violent an Opposer of a general Pardon, that therefore he himself was furnish'd before and wanted none: He hath indeed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly discover'd his blind side. But altho a good Act of Indempnity hath laid a Plaister on his Eye, and sear'd up his old Wounds; yet I doubt whether any Gentleman of the Insurance-Office will be so fond of his Acquaintance, or so secure of his good behaviour for the future, as to stand oblig'd that his Sores, if rub'd, will not break out afresh.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the wild Caprice of our loose Examiner, I hope no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of tolerable Nature will blame us, for our hearty acknowledgment of the Royal goodness, in maintaining our Religion, or condemn our Zeal, either for Addressing with Thanks for the Kings indulgence to some of our Fellow Subjects, or for Entreating him, if he thought it agreeable to his Service (which was the sole drift, as well as the very Letter of our Petition) to dispense his Clemency to a few others. And truly, tho it may now seem too late, to enter far into the Merit of the Petition, with respect to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the cause for which we interceded; yet for the necessary Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those who subscribed it, I think it expedient to offer the following Considerations; And therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the First Place, I observe that a Grand Jury (who represent the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a County) may be suppos'd to have a Right to Petition, for matters of an higher and more publick concern, than many other private Persons: Nor doth it Reflect upon us, that but few other Grand Juries have Petition'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our sort; or that the Addresses of some former Grand Juries have been very enormous; for a Priviledg is not lost by the non-usage, or by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or perverse Usage of him, or them, who cannot renounce the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Reflecter indeed has these Words; <hi>Some of us</hi> (says he) <hi>do question the Legality of Petitioning:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 4.</note> But whether he himself be a Conformist or Dissenter in the point, he leaves us to guess; and so do we the dispute of it among them. The Subscribers were agreed it was Legal,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36597:7"/> and not inconsistent with their Loyalty; of which the same Author grants they had the Opinion of able Lawyers: But put the Case we exceeded the just bounds of our Duty, I am sure we meant honestly; and tho' a good intent of the Will secures us not from being guilty of Mistakes in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may also betray us into practical Errors, such perhaps as will not only expose a man to the rash Reflections of his Adversaries, but justly tempt the best Men to censure and admonish him; yet doth it exempt us from the double Iniquity of intending ill, which the Examiner (whose reason evaporates into mere Rant and Sophistry) would perswade the World was our great design.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As we may Note a difference between a dispensation in favor of such who were already Bishops, and the preferring others (of a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Character) to the same Dignity; so I judge it necessary to observe, that we did not presume to Petition for the advance of any one to the Episcopal Charge, who scrupled the Oaths; for this would have been a most absurd Motion: But the Reason which prevail'd with our Grand Jury to Address, proceeded as from a sincere respect to their late Diocesan, and some others (of whose Probity, Innocence and Noble Confession, they had not been the careless Spectators) so from an humble Enquiry, whether for some Considerations (not repugnant however, to the Service due to his Majesty) no favour might have been extended to some few Non-Swearers, who had been already setled in the Cathedral Chair. (This Question the Reflecter endeavoured to evade, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our Address for the Bishops, with Respect to their being wholy depriv'd, whenas we Petitioned during their Suspension, at least before their Successors were Nominated, or admitted into their places; so that there was a possibility of their being restored) This I say was a question then; but his Majesty, and the Law have now decided it; and therefore we justly submit to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which K. <hi>William</hi> has made, who is by Nature as uncapable to design wrong, as he is in Honour averse to act it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place, it is not to be supposed, we should have so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Regard that was due from us to the Authority of the Legislators, as to have judged, that the Statute which enjoyns the Oaths, ought not to have a general Obligation; for we could not have had the pretence to obtain the benefit of our Petition, but by a New Act of Parliament, and consequently, by owning the Obligation of the Statute in force; so that I conceive it has been very absurdly objected to us, That our Petition was level'd against King, Lords and Commons; for our Adversary takes things for granted, which are not true in point of Fact: Our Petition being not for the abolishing or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating an Old Law, but for a mitigation of it, with Relation to the Bishops, by a new Statute: Besides, the severe words of the Examiner seem to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, as tho we disputed the Authority of his Majesty, and of the States of the Realm: But I hope no moderate man will so far encourage the Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Fancy, as to draw such a fundamental Treachery out of our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for we were not insensible of the respect that was due to the King and his Parliament, to the Prerogative of the one and to the Rights of the other; but rather from those Considerations we were the more secure in our design, since we neither addrest with thanks for a Pardon, which we thought they could not grant, nor Petitioned for a favour they could not dispense.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Had his Majesty, or the Parliament refused to have allowed our Petition, this would not necessarily have noted us of Arrogance, or put a Slur upon the Petitioners: For as their admitting our Request, would have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36597:8"/> been an Exercise of their Authority, so the refusing it, would have been a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same power: And tho the Government (if our Petition had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) might have been said, to have taken into their consideration the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desires of a Grand Jury; yet by their refusal, they could not properly be said to dissent from us, or; we from them; for we must be suppos'd as to be concluded, so to be satisfy'd with their Conduct, and not to Examine the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of their Refusal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it follows, that our Address was a Petition for favour, and not a claim of a Positive Right; for such a demand would rather have been a Remonstrance, than an humble Petition; but we were well satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d, that if our Request had not been allowed, we should have had no wrong done to us by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; tho this cannot however excuse those busie Gentlemen, who thought it their Duty and Interest, to stifle and prevent our Application to the Prince. I confess we fell short in one Circumstance of our Duty;<note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f our Address.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, When our Adversaries have spoken their parts, as will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by all sensible Men, their Arguments against our Address, whatever they are pleased to make them infer, do not of their own Nature prove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but seem rather to accuse it as inconvenient; and whether it was so or no, his Majesty for whose Consideration it was intended, and who alone in proper speaking, could grant or avoid it, must be presumed to have been the sole Judge to determine; so that we are not accountable to any of them, in a Concern that is Foreign to their Cognizance, tho otherwise we are content to gratifie their Ambition of their being thought Grand Courtiers and Politicians, and allow them a pretence to the State and Majesty of the Lyons, which guarded King <hi>Solomons</hi> Throne.</p>
               <p>Having Premis'd these few plain Notes, which I have not set down to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the reckoning of dispute, but rather to alleviate the dreadful Charge, to which we have been Sentenc'd by some mens Charity; I proceed to the consideration of the other Objections, that lye scatter'd in our Authors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inst our Address. And truly, who would not deride that Cavil of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer whereby we are inform'd, that in our Petition for the Bishops we stumbled unhappily upon the Word <hi>[The Bishops serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Majesties in their several Provinces]</hi> and that it should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been serving God Almighty?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 23.</note> Indeed this is a grand Exception wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our Clergy-man, who in a sudden heat, was so intent upon the Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that he forgot what a more Carnal Officer of the Church-Militant has laid down in Opposition to him: For the Reflecter assures us, That Their Majesties Service is as much the necessary Employ of Bishops,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 7.</note> as of other Peers. I could enlarge on this Head, and tell the Examiner, That the Service of the Prince in matters just and agreeable, is a Service of God: But I perceive our Clergy-man has such Correspondence at <hi>Rome</hi> (for he hath given us many occasions to think him no great Enemy of that Court) that I believe he would be content, that neither our Lords-Primates, nor any other of our <hi>English</hi> Bishops, should be the Servants either of God or the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36597:8"/> King in this Nation, but that we should be govern'd by another High-priest, who Stiles himself the Servant of the Servants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Nor am I on this account chargeable with uncharitableness, since our Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Author gives us the Notion of a Bishops mediate and immediate Service. A pleasant need not formerly laid down by an Old <hi>Jesuit,</hi> to exempt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from the Service of Temporal Princes! But the Famous Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Abhorring the evasive juggle, affirm'd, that this Distinction will be of no stead at the Day of Judgment.

'Tis a Delightful Consideration, that the Industry and Concurrence both of our Deprived and Conforming Bishops, Defeated the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues of Father <hi>Ellis,</hi> and his Three Associates, who made but Four Diocesses, and One Province of our whole Nation.

               <p>The Reflecter, whose good will is not to be purchas'd at any cheaper rate, than by making him our Confessor, is much concern'd to know who sprang the Design of our Address;<note place="margin">

O Mighty jealousie, which sowers every thing! Some fancy Suspicion to be an Argument of Wisdom, as if people could not discover their Brains, but by shewing their Teeth. But truly, the Spring from whence it came, to use his own Metaphor, was the Respect some Persons (I need not tell of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) had for the Suspended Fathers. And as the Gentlemen of the Grand-jury, had no other Prompter but their own Experience, to satisfie them of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Innocence, Piety and Constancy of the Bishops; so they had no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, but Charitable Inclination, and good Will to Petition for them. It this be not agreeable to that Policy, which some account Modish, it may not however be repugnant to Christian Charity, and in this thought we take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, tho we cannot pacifie the severe Reflections of others.</p>

               <p>But of all Men, give me the Examiner for a Person the most kind to the Prelates:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 23.</note> He objects to us, that our Address was an Affront to them, We having Petitioned for their Pardon, who he says wanted none. This indeed is a strange and unexpected impeachment; and how can the poor Subscribers avoid the Stroke of the Allegation? It seems for once, that we must so far pay a Respect to the <hi>Normans</hi> Conquest, as to Consult what the Authors, who are suppos'd to understand the Sense of those words, which we derive from that People, speak in this Case: They tell us, that a Pardon do's not only signifie <hi>Veniam,</hi> but that it also denotes <hi>favorem Gratiae Pacis &amp; Benevolentiae gratuitum:</hi> And therefore if we consider it in this Latitude, the Examiner, or any such like Friends of the Bishops, have little reason to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach us, as tho we had affronted them: For the Bishops Refusal or Omission to Swear, had render'd them Subject to a certain <hi>paena damni,</hi> and to many Legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacities, which can never be taken off, but by a Capacitating Law; and even such a Favour, is no less than an especial Grace, that Remits the Omission of what was otherwise very necessary to be done. And yet if we take the word Pardon, in our Examiners narrow Sense, and at the same time consider the words of the Petition, as they were Abbreviated in the Apology to which his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection refers, the Cavil will appear to carry with it the true Spirit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: For after we had returned our thanks to his Majesty, for his Resolution to grant to all his Subjects (except such as in his Princely Wisdom, he should Distinguish from the rest) his Gracious Pardon: The Apology informs, that we desired the like Favour to our Bishops, particularly our Diocesan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which words 'tis plain, we Petitioned for a Favour, not the same, but like to that of a Pardon; like in respect of the Fountain, from whence it must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, which is the Kings Indulgence; like in respect of the Conveyance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be perform'd in Parliament; and like in respect of the End, which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Service due to his Majesty. A Novice in the Schools can tell us, that every like, is not the same. And several who have perused a Copy of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Address can testifie, that we Petitioned for a Favour in the General Term, and only thank't his Majesty for a Pardon.</p>
               <p>I confess I took up some few Pages to prove, that the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> are the Fountains of all Acts of Grace; but as I there endeavour'd to Defeat the sorry Arguments which were proclaim'd in the Ears of the Unthinking People, to the prejudice of the Title of our Address; so can no person take occasion from that Discourse, to conclude there are no other Acts of Grace, than that of a Pardon; for we should then confound the <hi>Genus,</hi> and the <hi>Species;</hi> and the Examiner who pretends to the Highest Pertch of <hi>Logick,</hi> would soon tumble down <hi>Porphyry's</hi> Tree, and 'tis pitty to let our pert Clergy-Man perish, before his time.</p>
               <p>I need not in this place, offer any thing to satisfie the Reflecters wonder,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> why the Petition was not directed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; it was not out of Disrespect to them, or their Authority: But whereas our Paper carryed in it our Address of thanks to King <hi>William,</hi> for his draught of Pardon sent down to the Lords House; so it was not irregular to respect the same Fountain of Grace and Favour in our Petition for the Bishops; nor can we think the Parliament would have bin averse to any thing which his Majesty might first espouse and recommend to their Consideration.</p>

If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on these persons Treachery in the late Reign, with respect to their fulsom Addresses against our Laws and Religion, in Compliance with an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Unlimited Power, inconsistent with both; I am not much to blame, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since they now pretend to be therefore better Subjects than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; because they stint the Authority Imperial, which by our Fundamental Laws, is lodg'd in the King, and Exclaim in the Language or Decree of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Ocean, Hitherto O proud Prerogative, shalt thou go and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Reflecter seems to be astonished, that the Petitioners should pretend to take to themselves the Title of his Majesties most Loyal Subjects. To satisfie our Authors Curiosity, I observe, that Honest Men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> usually measure their Duty with due proportion to the Object; and therefore since King <hi>William</hi> is the most High, the most Serene, and his most Excellent Majesty; it was requisite that a Grand jury (who by their Office are immediately employed in the Affairs of the Crown) should testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their submissions to the Soveraign, with the most Humble, and the most sensible Regard. And truly, no Persons ought to be Scandaliz'd at the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if we would Exclude other Men from a just claim to the same Character, since in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, a Superlative do's not always imply Comparisons more than the Positive Degree; for tho the Examiner be most Learn'd, it do's not follow, but that the Reflecter may (without injury to Grammar) be as learn'd as he or any other Pamphleteer in the Town.</p>
               <p>The Reflecter might esteem me unkind to his Memory, if I should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his Elegant flight, by which he seems to recommend himself to us, as the Mouth and <hi>Pythia;</hi> or at least a profest Advocate of the true Canting Tribe. <hi>We are glad, saith he, to hear our Grand-jury openly profess Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We know our own Forwardness and Constancy: We know what our Preaching and Prayers have bin, and are before we were called to Fasting and Prayers, and how we have endeavoured with all our Might, to attain the Ends of them. We were not only for the Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s coming in, and taking the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but for his being King. We wished that nothing might hinder him from going to</hi> Ireland, <hi>and God hath wonderfully answer'd our daily Prayers for Success, and a safe Return; for which we rejoyce, and praise the Lord of</hi> Hosts, <hi>and should have ventured our Lives, in doing the Office of our Ministers with our Country-men, had there been any such need of their Marching against the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Jacobites &amp;c.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36597:10"/> is a strict Observation of the Law, Exclusive of others of the same pretence. A poor Publican and Sinning Subscriber, must not be named the same Day with them. We are glad to hear that their Loyalty is fixt upon the strong Principles of Religion and Obedience; the time was (I speak by the Reflecters own way of Argument) when they were of another mind. We have known the Affections of many of them, to the Family of <hi>Orange,</hi> before their taking upon them the Government, when they seduc'd our late <hi>English Absalom</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Royalty: For as <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> so would our Gracious Soveraigns (had that Rebellion prosper'd) have suffered in the Person of their Father, suffer'd, I say, in the Natural Sense of the words; for the Jealousie of Victorious Princes, seldom permit Rivals to escape the last Extremity. We have known some Mens Conversion to Loyalty, which was no less Extravagant and Dangerous in its Effects, than the other Projects of their Brethren: For these High-flown <hi>Jacobites,</hi> resolved to Expiate for their former Crimes by committing greater, and to Appease their New Patron, by Sacrificing the Rights and Interests of their present Majesties, and the whole Nation to an unnatural Bigottry: We have known their Prayers and Preaching; for their Sermons, Writings and Petitions against Popery, may be gathered out of the <hi>Gazets,</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign. We have known the Sincerity of these Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Men, to maintain the Protestant Religion, and the <hi>English</hi> Liberties, with their Lives and Fortunes, when they accepted an Equivalent, which the Prince by his Pentionary <hi>Fagel,</hi> discover'd to be Destructive of both. We have known, at least we have heard of their former Obedience to the Lord of Hosts, when the Day was their own, and their Saints Rod in the High Places of the Earth; for our Judaizing Loyalists, enclin'd not to the Divinity, nor to the Language of the Gospel, but were for reviving the Old Law, when the Priest sounded the Trumpet of War, when the Tabernacle rested in the Camp, and when the great God, Gracious and Merciful, was pleased to be called the Lord of Hosts. In fine, we have known when this new Brood of Loyalists came into the Roll; and as we now rejoyce at their Conversion to Loyalty, so we wish them the Grace of Perseverance, that they may never back-slide or be given to change.</p>
               <p>And whereas our Reflecter in his Bravado, told us, that he was not only for the <hi>Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s coming in, and taking the Government, but for his being King,</hi> he would do well to explain what he designs by this strong Principle of Loyalty, to which he will not consent our Subscribers must pretend. If he means he was for the Prince's taking the Government, and being King at the time he first Landed amongst us; we dar'd not I confess, to joyn in so Arrogant a piece of Loyalty, in affront to that very Prince, who then published to the whole World, that he had no other thoughts, but to settle some grand disputes in a Free-Parliament: This was the full sense of the Famous Declaration, which subdued all our Hearts, and purchas'd the Nation, without the Trouble and Hazard of a Conquest. How did Men, Women and Children then look up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, to consult the Winds and Weather, and desired God to send them a Blessing from the <hi>East!</hi> The Reflecter and his Friends, were not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone joyful People; for all Qualities and Sexes joyn'd in the Acclamation of a general Triumph: They kist the Hand of the Illustrious <hi>Nassau,</hi> they Adored his Shadow, they prayed for his Life, and were perswaded by the pleasant Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of their charmed Eyes, that every Tree did bear Lawrel for the Head of their Deliverer.</p>
               <p>If he means he was for his being King during the great Conventionary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; I acknowledge we could not pretend to give our Verdict in that high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy; and I may demand, whether our Representatives did ever consult our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36597:10"/> State-Casuist in so nice a Point? But if he says, he was for his being King when he was actually so, he has made a wonderful and a very strong disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and I would fain know, why he will not suffer us to be of the same mind with him, or at least permit us to, subscribe to the judgment of a more Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Person, who declar'd, that tho he understood not how to make a King, yet he knew how to obey him.</p>
               <p>I before observ'd, that our Reflecter at one dash of kindness separated some Persons of our Grand-jury, from the Number of Loyalists, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but because they have a particular Devotion for the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And truly, since he hath at this sort traduc'd our good Mother, who is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by her Children; he must not be displeased, if I pacifie his hot Zeal, by discovering of what import, and upon what odd principles many mens Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is built, who are her sworn Enemies. In doing this, I cannot be thought to act an unjust part; and if any Persons are displeased with it, they must either Renounce their fond Principles, or else submit to the Reflection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out casting a Reproach upon us, as though we had misrepresented them.</p>
               <p>And therefore, in the first place, I demand how a grand Pretence to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, fixt upon the principle of Religion and Obedience to King <hi>William,</hi> who hath own'd himself obliged by Oath; as also by Royal Promise to maintain the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in all its Rights, Priviledges and Immunities, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with a certain League and Covenant, which some persons have taken, and as yet think Obligatory? What Reply can they reasonably offer, unless they tells us they have found out the contrivance of doubling the Altar at <hi>Delos?</hi> The Words of the League, to which they stand bound, run thus: Viz. <hi>That without Respect of Persons, they will endeavour the extirpation of our Church Government by Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that they will not give themselves to a detestable Indifferency, or Neutrality in this Cause, but all the days of their Lives, Zealously and Constantly continue therein against all Opposition, and promote it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Power, against all Letts and Impediments whatsoever: All which they will do as in the Sight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a late Oath to a King, and yet an Old Covenant against him too, for being a Lett and Impediment to their resolv'd design. Here is a sworn Fidelity to a Church of <hi>England</hi>-Prince, with a Salvo of Canonical Obedience to the League they enter'd into against the same Church. If they are true to the first Obligation, they are false to the latter; they cannot I suppose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be true to both, unless they carry a double heart, and the Face of <hi>Janus.</hi> For to be sincere both to King <hi>William,</hi> who is led by Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and also to the Old Covenant, which indispensably obliges to avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d all Terms of Moderation; is a fancy altogether as new and strange as that, which possest a grand Casuist of our times, who declar'd that his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>egiance to King <hi>James,</hi> was not superseded by his Oath to King <hi>William</hi> (indeed this is an Age of Paradoxes, and secular interest is the great Lord of Hosts and King Paramount) I would not be thought to exasperate, or to obstruct the blessed design of an Union among Protestants, for which all good Christians ought incessantly to pray; but I may reasonably observe, that as no exact Loyalty, so no true Union can be expected, if men are govern'd by an irreconcilable Prejudice.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Loyalty of some others, I mean those Republican Zealots, who at present joyn in the separation from the Church for which we have a Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who formerly supplanted the Covenanters in their Authority to be esteem'd, as the Natural result of a sincere Principle. What Repentance have they declar'd for their old Iniquities? Their Words might then obtain some Credit with the World: What new Atchievements of Loyalty have they to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36597:11"/> produce? Their Actions would then speak highly in their favor: Some of them are I confess therefore quiet, because they are at their Ease, because they Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouze and Drink at the Fountain of Mercy, because they Revel at the Banquet of our great <hi>Abasuerus;</hi> and yet they will scarce permit others to feed on the Crumbs that fall from his Table. God forbid I should envy the bounty of our Royal Master, to those who came into his Service, or rather Protection at the Eleventh h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur. However, it seems unreasonable that they who did not bear any part of the Burthen, or heat of the day, but are enter'd into the Harvest of other mens Labours, should so highly pretend as to Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize all Merit to themselves, as though they had purchas'd the claim with the sweat of their Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and the hazard of their Lives. In short, as these would be Patriots (I mean those who usually flatter themselves with a recital of their Performances) were far from being the happy Instruments of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Advance it gain'd in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> at the brave Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Bishops, to the glorious Consummation it there received at the Installment of their Majesties, and compos'd not the Body of the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy who introduc'd it, but by their Treacherous practices did rather obstruct and oppose it: So all that can be offer'd by their best Friends in favour of their present Carriage is, that they have not yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former Vote of their Scarlet-Saints (nor God be thanked is it in their Power) Seiz'd, Imprisoned, Arraigned, Condemned and Beheaded the whole Race of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi> And indeed their boasted Loyalty to Crown'd Heads, may fitly be compared to the Courtesie of the Raparees; who, that I may use <hi>Cicero's</hi> words, are said <hi>to be kind, and to give a man his Life, when they don't Murther him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this strong principle, old Mr, <hi>Capel</hi> formerly gave the world a notable Specimen; for when a Gentleman inform'd that godly Preacher, that the Saints who then governed at Court, were much enclin'd to the Opinion of the Fifth Monarchy, and presum'd that in their days, Christ would commence his Temporal Reign on Earth; he answer'd, let not Christ then adventure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> lest they cut off his Head, as they have already done his Vicegerent's. But the Tragedy of the Royal Martyr, is by them now quite hist off the Stage as an old VVives Fable, and must not be so much as named, unless it be to justifie and to ridicule it. For though a subscribing Grand-jury-man be an unpardonable Sinner; even Murther, Rapine, Treason and Sacriledge are adjudged to be but Venial Crimes in many of the Party; Nay, sometimes Meritorious Atchievements when perpetrated for the Honour and Service of their <hi>Moloch</hi> the good old cause: At most they make but a nine days VVonder in the opinion of those Jesuited people, who are forward and severe in censuring the Faults and Frailties of other men, but cannot endure to be told their own; and like the lew'd VVoman in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, enhaunce their guilt by a Profession of their honesty.</p>
               <p>I have with great reluctance been led from a Subject of Peace and good VVill (for such was our Petition) to consider the Crimes of any Persons, and with as little delight have I Reflected on the Iniquity of former times; but I may be excus'd, if besides the provocations of the Reflecter, and others of his Brethren which gave the occasion to a Discourse of this Nature, we consider with what industry and cunning the same Spirit does endeavour to act its part in our Age: And therefore no Person has just cause to censure me, as bearing no due respect to the Act of Oblivion in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds Reign. I do not doubt after the Jews return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> their City and Temple being rebuilt, and the true VVorship reinstated among them; but that God in Mercy gave them a Plenary Act of Oblivion, and fulfilled the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36597:11"/> words of the Prophet in vacating the Old Proverb, <hi>Of the Fathers Eating sower Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth being set on Edge:</hi> And yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Act of Grace, which far exceeded the general Amnesty granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> to the Enemies of his Family; Our Saviour doth not think it inconsistent with Justice, to charge the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time with the Murther of all the Prophetical Martyrs from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zachariah.</hi> VVhat did those VVords import, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> were guided by the Spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> that slew his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of their own Forefathers that destroyed their Prophets? By this instance it is evident, that an Evil Principle is not to be sheltered under any Protection: And an Act of Oblivion seems in a great part designed, as for the Encouragement of Penitents by a Solemn display of Mercy; so to prevent some grand Enormities from being discoursed of, lest the corrupt Nature of man be infected with the Leprosie and Itch, with desire after Evils which long disuse might render not so very practicable. VVould to God we had no such Infection in our Age; and I wish that Men of knowledg were not infected, at least that they who pretend to Loyalty were none of the Party. But alass! there are too many, who seem willing to Copy the Deformity of the last Age, which saw our State reduc'd to Anarchy and Confusion by a prevailing Faction; and how can the vulgar escape the Net, when they are drawn into Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by those who would be esteemed the Friends of the Government, or would purchase that Name at any Rate? VVe have heard much Discourse of the Loyalty of one of King <hi>William</hi>'s pretended humble Servants, who was pleased in Print to admonish his Majesty of several Miscarriages. He told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Affairs of State were like a bewitcht Cart, which being at first easily drawn, on a sudden became immoveable: That the Form of the order (which was no other than for a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for having made the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the glorious Instrument of our great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Popery and Arbitrary Power) had little of the Majesty of God concern'd in it; but was of dangerous consequence, and an indication of an unhappy temper, prevalent in the Assembly. VVhat could a rank <hi>Jacobite</hi> have said worse? And what Language could better gratifie the designs of the French <hi>Louis?</hi> But he takes the most sensible offense and indignation, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should find King <hi>James's</hi> departure an Abdication, and contrary to the concurrent Votes of those who have submitted to the Government not out of private Interest and Revenge, but for Conscience sake seems willing to keep open that breach as a reserve, I suppose for him and his party on Future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies; and therefore says, it should have been declar'd a Flight of a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal from Justice. O Loyalty fixt upon a strong Principle! It seems some men were not unprovided of another Consecrated Axe, and a block for the Service of their cause. They formerly bestow'd the Present upon the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; they threatned the Father whom they had so lately Caressed, with a Tast of the like courtesie; no doubt but the Son will beware of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Kisses of such <hi>Judas</hi> Loyalists.</p>

Behold the strong Principles of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Obedience of our Modern Loyalists, or (to use the Reflecters own Expression) We have known how late many of them came into the Roll. <hi>Qui alterum inculat probri, ipsum se intueri oportet,</hi> Rather than joyn our Names with such Loyalists, we will bear the Reproach, of having a particular Devotion for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Halcyon Wings have never yet bin dipt in Blood; and who tho flie governs her Children with the Authority of a grave Matron, yet she still preserves the Purity and the Innocence of a Virgin.</p>

               <p>Besides, if the Reflecter would suggest, that our Petition did hearten the Enemies of the Government, he do's us wrong; for how could any of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have enjoy'd the benefit of the King's Grace, without entertaining it as such? And the Acceptance of the Favour, as it would have imply'd their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to the present Powers, in a very material Case; so would <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and all the Enemies of our Establishment, have reapt no Advantage by the bargain.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 17.</note> to think that those Reverend Persons, had some doubts which forbad them to take the Oaths: and that tho uncharitable People were inclinable enough of themselves, to put an harsh Interpretation upon their Carriage, yet those who had a just measure of Charity for the Bishops,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 13. <hi>P.</hi> 14.</note> were willing to think (I am sure we should not otherwise have Petitioned) that those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Persons, did heartily rejoyce at the late Revolution, as carrying with it, the Happiness and Prosperity of the Protestant Religion, which otherwise would have bin at the bottom of Misery.</p>
               <p>But what do's the Reflecter mean, by telling the Subscribers, that the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Bishops had obstructed the Publick Service and Compliance of others, by their Example? If we consider this Reflection with respect to the Clergy, I may tell him, that never were Clergy more unanimous, in subscribing to so great a Revolution: Nor have there bin wanting among the Deprived Fathers, who when the Inferior Clergy apply'd themselves for Counsel to direct their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, advised them by all means, to Conform to the Government, in due Form and Ceremony, if they could in Conscience do it: And when a certain person, who seem'd to be an implacable Non-juror, and endeavoured to infect

And as at the time of our Petitioning, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observ'd, we knew nothing of any publick Service obstructed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Bishops; so we think the Service of those Men to be of little account who are led by meer Example without examining the Cause. And as the paucity of the Non-Swearers, as one of our Authors observ'd, render'd their Party inconsiderable; so the very few for whom we Petitioned, may satisfie all honest Men, that we thought not every Non-Swearer considerable enough or worthy a Priviledge, and so by Consequence we cannot be presumed to have Petitioned for Non-swearers meerly as such; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think I have no Reason to observe the Reflectors Quaere,<note place="margin">P. <hi>8.</hi> &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Consideration may in some measure qualifie the Heat of the Examiner, who says,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> that the Petitioners appearance for the Bishops, was more than a Tacit Reflection on others who took the Oaths. Now, as we have Sworn to the Government our selves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is hard Language to say that we meditated an Affront to our Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for having done the same. I know not what our Author means by the word Appearance, but if we take him speaking according to a very usual Phrase, we cannot but complain of his Uncharitable intimation, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is as good Argument as to aver, that in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any moderate Person for Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> who scrupled the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Habit, was more than a Tacit Reflection on the other Bishops who had no such scruple: This I am apt to believe in our Examiners Opinion, would be positive severity, and he is too partial to allow it to be over kind in the present Case; and indeed this reasoning is on all occasions destructive of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and of all Acts of Grace and Dispensation, and touches in some degree (if with <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Shepherd, we may presume to compare great things with small) even upon the measures of the Prince and Parliament, with respect to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Act of Indempnity; for at this Rate, because they entertain a mixt crowd of sinners into Favour, they must consequently reflect on those who need no Pardon. And whereas he tells us, our Appearance was Hearty and Zealous; I suppose he will admit that such Epithets usually belong to Honest Men, since they Import, that we were neither Fawning Hypocrites, nor Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing Flatterers.</p>
               <p>Our Examiner has these words: If the Church, says he,<note place="margin">

               <p>That we were not wanting of very good and very reverend Men to supply the vacant Sees, is, I confess, most true; and His Majesties care to fill the Orb of our Church with bright Luminaries, has demonstrated to the World, that the recess of six or seven Bishops, could not interrupt the succession of our Hierarchy, or stop the Efficacy of sound Doctrine, so that our Church was in no danger of an Eclipse; and the Gospel, God be prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho I might refer the Reader to the Proviso's, to interpret the design of what our Author offers in this place, yet it may be observed that those Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons, who succeeded to the late Bishops, as they did it with great regret and sorrow, so they would not only have bin well content, but very joyful too, if their Predecessors, who they allow to be of the indelible Character, could have entertain'd the favour for which we Petitioned, and thereby continu'd fix't Stars in our <hi>Horizon:</hi> And truly the Clergy of our Church were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as desirous as the <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> Grand-jury, that the Fathers should upon like reasonable terms have bin re-instated; as is apparent from a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Convocation, where a Petition, as I have been inform'd, was in agitation on their behalf.</p>
               <p>For such a favo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, and for such alone our Subscribers Petitioned, bearing a submissive deference to his Majesties Service and Inclination, who was to grant it; and respecting also, as has bin before intimated, a suppos'd readiness in those for whom we Petitioned, both to have accepted, and to have esteemed it a Favour, and to have done their part to entertain and preserve it; which as it would necessarily have imply'd some certain security, consisting with His Majesties Honour, as well as their own Consciences, so we cannot be suppos'd to have desired it out of any affront and disservice to His Majesty or them: And if there could be no such security propos'd or accepted, the Petitioners declar'd their good Will; and they have this effect of their Petition, that they calmly endeavour'd the Peace and Union of our Church, and publish'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves King <hi>William</hi>'s Loyal Subjects, and it is none of their fault, that all others are not so too.</p>
               <p>But why do's our Examiner affirm, that their Re-establishment would have bin out of the ordinary Road? It must, I confess, have bin by Act of Parliament, but that is a Road His Majesty do's ordinarily Travel in; and how can one, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd by Statute, be otherwise restor'd? But we were hopeful, says he,<note place="margin">Id.</note> there were no such miseries impending upon our Church thro the Bishops Suspension, as the fear of them should oblige Us to break thro Laws and Acts of Parliament, meerly for their sakes. Very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verendly observ'd! And yet, what does our Author mean by the word Us? must we consider him in his Pluralities, both as an Examiner, and as a Clergy-man, or rather must we consider him as another <hi>Araunah,</hi> giving like a King, some great matters to the King? He do's indeed afford His Majesty a joynt Authority, and therefore adds the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> Which is the thing the Grand jury of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> by their Address, would have the King to do: So that our Author either thinks himself a King, or at least his Companion; and as I and the King was the Aspiring <hi>Wool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But leaving the right Doughty and Puissant Prince Us to himself, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may please to observe, that the Import of our Address to King <hi>William,</hi> was in short, no other, than that he would have granted a Favour to the Bishops in the like Form he intended to dispense his General Pardon, which was by Act of Parliament; and for our Examiner to assert, that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Petitioned him to break through Laws and Acts of Parliament, is as sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly apply'd, as to say, that our Clergy-man do's break thro his own Church when he first opens the Door with the proper Key, and then passes in State and Gravity to the Altar.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36597:13"/>
               <p>The Reflecter says, that the Deprived Bishops have taken an Oath of an harder Construction to the former Kings,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 7.</note> the last whereof was a profest <hi>Papist.</hi> But do's he in his present Zeal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the whole Nation, who took Oaths to the former Kings, even all that swore Allegiance to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and was the Oath they Swore to him of an harder Construction, than that we have taken to their present Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sties? Besides, tho the late King <hi>James</hi> was a profest <hi>Papist,</hi> yet he was received and accounted our lawful King before. Now, an Oath of Allegeance to a lawful King cannot, according to our Reflecter, be of an hard Construction: and if our Bishops are now scrupulous of taking an Oath, because they think it of an hard Construction, what reason is there to imagine they were less Conscientious, formerly, then they are under his present Majesty? Can we think King <hi>William,</hi> or Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> (notwithstanding the Confidence of a late <hi>Pseudo-martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist</hi>) are better pleas'd with those that would have Dethron'd their Father, and set up an Intruder, destructive of their Title to the Succession, than with such as adher'd to him in Opposition to <hi>Monmouth?</hi> who were there of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecters Party that appear'd for his present Majesty, when that unfortunate great Man strove for the Crown? the Subscribers are not of the Bishops judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in refusing the Oaths, but hope at least, if they deserve not to be pittied because they cannot overcome their scruples, that they ought not however to be stun'd with a Reflection for their former Fidelity and Loyalty before the Abdication, which was indeed of an hard Construction when they maintain'd it, tho they suffer'd so much for it.</p>
               <p>Our Author demands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> what difference there is between Dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Disaffection. I hope I may tell him without consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Concordance, that every Doubt do's imply Dissatisfaction, tho not Disaffection.</p>
               <p>In short, Dissatisfaction is grounded on the understanding and reason, Disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the will and Passions: And thus much to our Reflecters question in General, I shall now consider it with a Particular regard to our present Case.</p>
               <p>It is apparent, that the Bishops Non-complying with the Government, and refusal to Swear, proceeded from a dissatisfaction in their minds, arising from certain Scruples, which as I did not pretend to examin, so do I not now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to wade into such Niceties; but if they could have accepted a Favour on the Condition for which we petitioned, I know not how they could have bin disaffected in all points, where the Reflecter thinks they are dissatisfied. I am sure Disaffection cannot but improve; and if any of the Persons for whom we Petitioned, have combin'd with the Enemies of our Nation, and endeavoured to render others dissatisfied; by this plain disaffection, they have put themselves out of the capacity of the Favour for which we Petitioned, and they may be said to be as much dissatisfied with our Petition as with the Government. I do not at present much concern my self to know, whether there be any such, or who they are; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, supposing some or all of them would have thought it no Priviledge to have accepted the Grace, I pray of what great Iniquity were the Subscribers guilty in endeavouring to reconcile them to a just opinion of his Majesties Favour, or in humbly Petitioning the great Arbiter of Justice and Mercy, that a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation might be granted to such of the Fathers, as would render themselves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying the Indulgence, and give in exchange the Testimony and Assurance of their peaceable Deportment?</p>
               <p>Was it reasonable in the Reflecter and his Party to contract and engross the Favour of Kings, or dutiful in them to set limits to the Royal Bounty, and prescribe to their Majesties as if on a Journey, where they shall Lodge, and Dine? Or was it fair that their Fellow-Subjects should partake of the Courtesie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36597:14"/> of their snarling, and be expos'd to the sorry condition of the poor Brethren of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who are kept off from asking an Alms by the terrour of a <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>'s Moustache, or by the more incorrigible rudeness of the Porter's Dog.</p>

And thus as I hope, the two great Prelates of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> will be good Friends on Earth, I am sure they will be no Enemies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

               <p>But the <hi>Reflecter</hi> had an Eye upon the Revenues as well as the Government of the Church, and gravely tells us<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</note>, he was willing the Non-jurors should be allowed as large Revenues as they had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36597:14"/> before they were Bishops. We should have thankt our Author for this sudden kindness, if it had not been too luxuriant to be sincere; for in the same breath he seems to grudg at what he before granted, and adds as a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel to the Favour,<note n="*" place="margin">Idem.</note> Tho there are, saith he, Hundreds in the Work of the Lord who have scarce maintenance for themselves and Families.</p>
               <p>If by his Hundreds in the work of the Lord we are to understand the poor Clergy of our National Church, we could in a whisper tell him of some such that have had Augmentations; but because it was not done to be seen of men, it is not to be further spoken of. If he means the Episcopal Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we could remind him of a certain spirit of Moderation that has endeavoured to make a clean House in that Kingdom. But if he means, as some may be apt to guess, Dissenting Preachers, 'tis true there has been complaint that the Root of all Evil is growing even among their Saints, and that in these hard times they may serve the Hundreds in the work of the Lord as the <hi>Reflecter</hi> did the Petition, <hi>viz.</hi> hold their hands. Some may be apt to think, that the Revenues of our Bishops would have done good service in saving the Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ses of their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Votaries; time was they could seize on the Church-Revenues for that use. But for the Bishops to be restored to their Revenues, was rather the desire of their Friends than their Avarice; nor did the Subscribers of our Grand-Jury exemplifie their Petition in this particular. Indeed the Parliament, as I before hinted, were pleased to allot them, when his Majesty should judg expedient, the third part of the Revenues of their Bishopricks, vacant by reason of their Non-conformity. 'Tis well the publick Conscience hath more Charity, than the narrow benevolence of some private spirits. But the humble request of one of the deprived Fathers was, that he might have liberty to employ himself, and to spend the remainder of his days in the work of the Lord, <hi>Gratis,</hi> without looking after the Revenue, and was therefore far from the ambition of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it without doing his Office. And tho he contemns the world (I mean in a devout sense) yet is he no <hi>Mendicant,</hi> nor hath he need to be stinted by our strait lac'd <hi>Reflecter,</hi> or creep to his insulting Adversary for a piece of bread.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reflecter</hi> having represented our Petition for the Bishops in a false light, is loth by his good will to leave them so much as the thin covering of a good name, which he thinks might recommend them to the charity of others; and therefore shews his little malice, by endeavouring to traduce the unspotted Fame which is justly due, and is as generally paid to their former merit; not unlike that testy Animal, which in vain bay's at the brightness of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>He finds the Bishops esteem'd for two things, first their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. <hi>Pag.</hi> 14.</note> secondly the good they did the Nation in the late Reign. The last he speaks to first, as being the hardest to deal with, reserving his Reflections on the other, as that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him larger scope to vilifie them, and coming last would make greater impression on the Readers; but tho he seeks with all cunning to lessen, yet it passeth his skill to eclypse their worth, and he does but more and more disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his malevolence, and how much Envy prevails in the temper of his mind; for their Actions will be recorded, and they will shine as Stars in our Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as long as any remembrance of those Transactions is continued to future Ages, when his Reflections shall be buried in Oblivion, which last will be no loss to the <hi>Reflecter</hi>'s Reputation.</p>
               <p>Envy (as is observ'd) is stir'd up by the sight; the Pictures he sees so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (when he comes into some honest mens houses) no doubt are a great Eye-sore to such Reflecters; and to perfect his zeal in the next Pamphlet he writes, he should inveigh against the Printers, Sellers and Buyers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> such Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36597:15"/> for it may be they trouble him as much as the Petition for them.</p>
               <p>He says, that he and his party were as ready to suffer for not reading the Declaration as the Bishops for Petitioning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.</note> if they had been called to it. If the <hi>Reflecter</hi> be one of the Dissenting Party, as is more than likely from sundry passages in his Book; we may judge of the readiness of many of them to suffer for not reading King <hi>James</hi>'s Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by their thanks to him for it: but possibly they do not over-value the Bishops act of Suffering, because it gave so great a blow to Popery, which too many of the Addressors would rather let it (notwithstanding all their Clamors against it) than their lose sweet revenge upon the Church of <hi>England. Delenda est Carthago,</hi> and why must not the <hi>Remans</hi> give reason to the Allegory, and (as formerly) have the honour of the performance?</p>
               <p>When he comes to Reflect upon their Government, he thinks he has matter enough to pacifie the rage of his Spleen, and to feed a <hi>Vulture</hi> that would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise beak in upon his heart.</p>
               <p>Their Predecessors excell'd them, and he and his party found the change,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.</note> and that we had experience of the Government but of few of them. If this were true, how could our Author pretend to determine so Categorically against them with respect to their Predecessors? and if we are not to judge of Persons merit by Fame, why do we give credit to the Histories of former times which recorded their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>edecessors Government? and how will future Ages, that must be supposed to know things past not by sight, believe, that our Author speaks true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 14.</note> when he affirms, he was provided of better men to succeed them?</p>
               <p>Comparisons are odious, especially while any or most of the Persons are living, and therefore we leave a Theme which all ingenious men dislike, to such as he.</p>
               <p>But was it not more maliciously than honestly done, to tax the Bishops for being Authors of encreasing the Faction in the Nation, and to lay at their door the Iniquity of those times, which was the effect of Jesuitical Counsels?</p>
               <p>He tells us, as a part of their ill Government, what Preaching up of slavish Doctrines there had bin in their days,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note>
                  <hi>ad nauseam,</hi> to Ruin us. In Reflecting on the Preaching of the Bishops and their Clergy, he do's not mean that against <hi>Popery,</hi> which the World knows, none did more stoutly oppose than the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If the Reflecter means Preaching up Arbitrary Power, when he saith, Slavish Obedience was Preach't to promote the design of Ruining us; he hath forgot what the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were sent to the <hi>Tower</hi> and Tryed for: There will be Pick-thanks in all Ages, the present is not without a Reflecter.</p>
               <p>It may be he means the Doctrin of <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> as tho none but the six Bishops were guilty of that Primitive Heresie: But alas! This has bin reviv'd by the general practice of our Church; and we are not ashamed to own, that after the way which some call Heresie, we worship the God of our Fathers, and submit to our Princes; and the same Doctrine is implicitly enjoyn'd as in the 37th Article, so in the very first Canon of our Church, which commands all Licenc'd Preachers four times every Year, to declare, That the King within this Realm, is the Highest Power under God, to whom all Men, as well Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as Born within the same, do by God's Law, owe most Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And of this Obedience, the Homilies which were set by Authority as a Pattern for Preachers, and the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> which is allowed by a great Opposer of this Doctrine, as one of the best Books in the World; do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36597:15"/> make that which we call the Passive, a Ligitimate Branch. To these Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Articles and Canons, the Benefic'd Preachers do <hi>ex animo</hi> subscribe, as containing the setled Standard of Doctrine and Constitution, and therefore ought not to be blam'd for the doing that which on good grounds they think in Conscience is their Duty.</p>
               <p>But truly, the Reflecter, notwithstanding all his cunning to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, do's unawares (through his Zeal) appear in his own Colours. He pretends Scandal only at the Bishops for whom we Petitioned, but he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his Hatred to all of that Order, even their Predecessors; for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops are accused, and the Suspended Bishops must bear the blame. But, may we without Offence ask him a Question, of which he is free. Questions many times going for Arguments? And it may not displease, if we imitate him.</p>
               <p>To Ridicule <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> tho it may serve the turn of one Aspiring to the Throne as <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whether it will do him any Service that is setled in it? What security has that Prince, who depends on the <hi>Copricio</hi> of the Mob, and who are the best Artists to work upon their Humour?</p>
               <p>These Queries I leave with the Reflecter, and proceed to consider his other Exceptions against the late Government of the deprived Fathers: For having with all imaginable Artifice, Painted forth the Prosecution (a milder word, says he, then a true Persecution) of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> he lays it at the Bishops Door;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note> by which means he has Entituled himself to the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Post script.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would willingly be inform'd, why this matter should be objected to the Suspended Bishops. Make the worst of the Case, and suppose they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in it; I pray were not the other Bishops concern'd in an equal Sphere of Action with them? Were none Prosecuted but in their Diocesses? None in or about the great City, which is the Jurisdiction of another Prelate? Were these the only Men that (according to our Authors Language) influenced all Justices and Sessions? Here again, Bishops are accused, and the Suspended must bear the blame. And yet, with the Reflecters leave, of all Bishops, the Suspended Fathers have least to answer for on that account. Some of them were not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at that time; and if, I mistake not, one of them was then a Domestick Chaplain to the Princess at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and is it fair and plausible to force Men into the Catalogue, several Years before their time, upon no other Account but to Accuse, to Worry, and to Ridicule them? Some of his Friends will scarce allow them the courtesie of that Title, <hi>à Parte-Post,</hi> now they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd; but Oh! The singular qualifications of the Reflecter! If he proceeds at this Rate, he may shortly assume the Power of altering Times and Seasons, and pretend to the extraordinary Spirit of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who brought back the shadow of the Sun several degrees on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subscribers cannot give an Account of things done in all places; yet it is known, that where some were liable to the Laws then ordered to be put in Execution, they found among the Bishops, those, who, to their Power, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stood between them and the Penalty, but paid the Pecuniary Mulct for them. Others in the very heat of the Prosecution, did frequently testifie against the tendency of many Proceedings. It is apparent enough, by whose Policy, and by what Agents, the grand Extremities were set on Foot, and carried on; their design was to render our Church-Governors, and Church too odious, and this the Reflecter Prosecutes, they were not to reduce and gain <hi>Dissenters,</hi> but to make the breach wider between us, and what good effect of them in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any, could be look'd for, when the Separatists were underhand encouraged
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36597:16"/> and supported in their Obstinacy? And is it not an Invidious Slander, to charge the Bishops to have bin both Councellors and Overt-actors in them? It is worthy our consideration, whether they may be Branded as Persecutors, under the cover of whose wings the <hi>French</hi> Protestants obtain'd a Sanctuary, from what was really a Persecution, they found our Spiritual, to be instead of Natural Fathers, their Palaces an <hi>Asylum</hi> of Refuge; so that those poor Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, besides a grateful resentment of the great Charity and Bounty which supported their Languishing Spirits, gave Praise to God, that their Eyes were opened, and the mistakes and prejudices raised in them, by the Evil Reports and Slanders of our Adversaries, were removed.</p>
               <p>But truly, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were never so far deluled, as to give Credit to the false Colours, with which our Reflecter and other Masters of misrepresentation have Painted forth Her Bishops: For about the time of the Prosecution, when several <hi>Nonconformists</hi> had fallen foul on Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> for Preaching a very Orthodox Sermon, and spar'd neither Art nor Pains, not only to justifie their Schism, which they recommended as the Darling of Heaven, but at the same time to Vilifie the Establishment of our Church, as Unedifying, Superstitious and Tyrannical: Monsieur <hi>de l' Angle,</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Charenton</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> in his Famous Letter to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> in which he exprest his hearty Prayers to God, that he would open the Dissenters Eyes, to see the weakness of their Reasons, upon which they grounded an afflicting Separation, did with joy conclude, that by a wonderful Blessing of God, our Espiscopal Sees were filled with excellent Servants of God, who loved Jesus Christ, and who had all the Qualities of the Head and Heart for a general Union; to which in the Post-script he subjoyn'd, that his excellent Collegue Monsieur <hi>Claude</hi> did subscribe with all his Heart to the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Here, we may take a just occasion to observe the Sally, which the Reflecter makes upon the Clergy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> who have taken the Oaths. He Carps at them, for their choice of Convocation-men, and for returning to their old stiffness, tho, he says, they were for some time more limber and yeilding to an Union with Dissenters. I have discours'd some of the Electors on this point, and by what I find the Reflecters pleading for <hi>Dissenters,</hi> is no more to be blam'd, then for <hi>Carthegus</hi> to plead for <hi>Cataline;</hi> and tho, in their choice of Convocation-men, they had an Eye to such as would not betray the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet it may be excused, when 'tis considered what has bin done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and if this do's anger those who are Enemies to our Constitution, yet I hope it is no great offence to it's Friends,</p>
               <p>But, why is this passage brought in by the Reflecter, whose Text obliges him not to ramble, or lead his Reader from the deprived Fathers? Can this be assign'd as a miscarriage of their former Government? Or are they now just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargable on this account, as though it were done by them, or by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation? Must they be suppos'd to neglect a duty of which the Law renders them uncapable, or intrude into the Province of the other Bishops? He might as well accuse them for not appearing the last Session in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 7.</note> and alledge for his Reason, that the Conforming Bishops are bound in Honour and Conscience, to Vote for the Interest of His Majesty. On the other hand, what reason has he to reflect on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who have taken the Oaths, or to affront the conforming Clergy, who in their choice of Convocation-men, usually pay some deference to the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their <hi>Diocesans;</hi> and who (without flattery) Elected many Learned and Pious Men, of which 'tis well known, that Reverend Assembly was, for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36597:16"/> most part composed. It is plain and evident, that the Dart is thrown against our Bishops and Clergy, both depriv'd, and not depriv'd, and the depriv'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Reflecter finding the Parliament had cut the <hi>Gordian-knot,</hi> which could not be unty'd by a Convocation, and wherein, no doubt, he was bound to the good behaviour with the rest of his Brotherhood (for 'tis not Union with our Church, as is the specious pretence, but the Liberty of Acting and Speaking against her, which too many really desire) endeavours to ingratiate himself and his Party with them, in the like confident manner, as he has affronted the other.

Thus King <hi>James,</hi> after his coming to the Throne, was pleased to Declare, that it had bin his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sense and opinion, that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forc't in matters of Religion; and that it was ever directly contrary to his Inclinations, and yet notwithstanding, the formality of this pretence, there are many in our Nation, who can testifie, with what heat and application they were incited, and prompted, by the same Persons, to put the Penal Laws in Execution in his Brother's days. And therefore, as the last Prosecution of the Dissenters, was a plain design of the Court, and not of our Church; so I could tell our Reflecter, how severely some of our Bishops were reprimanded, for refusing to comply with many inordinate Commands dispatch'd to them, which they knew, were not design'd to reform, but to inflame the Parties,</p>
               <p>In short, If the Avarice of the Chancellors (for there are ill Men in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,) if the Huxtry of Informers; for such Penal-Law Mongers have bin frequent in all Ages: If the underworking of the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> for Father <hi>Campi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> so from our former sequestrations, and the late <hi>Scottish</hi> Severities against the Episcopal Clergy, whose cries have penetrated the very Rocks and Flints of that hardned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet by the Doctrine of our Church, all Exorbitant, and Bloody, and Revengeful Proceedings, which tend rather to the Ruin of Mens Persons and Estates, than the Salvation of Souls, are justly condemned: And, whereas the Reflecter enquires, whether any of the Bishops (Oh! General Challenge.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note>) have ever shewed any dislike of Severities, or wish'd for the mitigation of the Laws, under which the Dissenters smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I may direct him for satisfaction, in this Case, to the the Articles recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by our late Lord Primate <hi>Sancroft,</hi> to the Bishops within his Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Jurisdiction; where, among many other serious Admonitions, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised them and their Brethren, the Clergy, to walk with wisdom, towards those that are not of our Communion; <hi>and if there be in their Parishes any such, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36597:17"/> they neglect not frequently to confer with them in the Spirit of Meekness, seeking by all good ways and means to gain and win them over to our Communion. More espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that they have a very tender regard to our Brethren, the Protestant Dissenters; that, upon occasion offer'd, they visit them at their Houses, and receive them kindly at their own, and treatithem fairly where-ever they meet them, discoursing calmly and civily with them, persuading them, if it may be, to a full compliance with our Church; or, at least, whereto we have already attain'd we may all walk by the same Rule, and mind the same Thing; and, in order hereunto, that they take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of assuring and convincing them, that the Bishops of this Church are really and sincerely irreconcilable Enemies to the Errors, Superstitions, Idolatries and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and that the very unkind Jealovsies, which some of them had of us to the contrary, were altogether groudless; and, in the last place, they warmly and most affectionately Exhort them to joyn with us in daily fervent Prayer to the God of Peace, for an universal Ʋnion of all Reformed Churches, both at Home and Abroad, against our Common Enemies; and that all they who do confess the Holy Name of our Dear Lord, and to agree in Truth of the Holy Word, may also meet in one Holy Communion, and live in perfect Ʋnity and Godly Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was a truly Christian and treatable Spirit; here was an advice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Design of the Gospel; and though it be a morsel which the <hi>Keflacter</hi> cannot swallow, yet is it a necessary Viand to such whose Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to administer the Eucharistic Feasts. To conclude, though we do not agree with the <hi>Reflecter,</hi> either in Affection to the Church of <hi>England</hi> or the Bishops, yet we will be in Charity with him and the Dissenters, and tell him plainly (though he taxes our Convocation with Stifness, and sentences the Bishops of our Church, to a Title something softer than that of real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors) that no geod Churchman does begrudge the Indulgence granted to them, if they use it with Prudence and acknowledge the Favour: Nor is he against any Expedient of Union, if we knew what would satisfie and what was practicable, provided the Protestant Religion might be preserv'd, and no gap left open to let in swarms of Sects, Atheism, and, it may be, Popery and Contempt of all that is Sacred.</p>
               <p>Another main flight of the Reflecters Zeal against the deprived Bishops, which I must not pass by, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 17.</note> that they did not publish a satisfactory Answer, to the Modest Inquiry in Vindication of themselves. But, certainly they had little reason to call him, who writes a Vindication of those who oppos'd the Petition for them, to help them to make their own, not knowing, but he might have a hand in Composing the Inquiry (which may now pass for no idle suspicion, since he appears so concern'd at their Reply to it) then indeed they had bin well Vindicated, when the Accuser of the Brethren, was become their Advocate. He acknowledges, they declared against Plotting, and in another place, that he believes, they would be peaceable. What Reason then, and what Christianity did prompt our two modest Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to wound them with their Pens, against whom nothing at that time did appear worthy such sharp usage?</p>
               <p>'Tis not, I confess, my design to Vindicate the late Conduct of one or more of the Bishops: They are Men, and may not only have failings, but be guilty of matters of a worse tendency, and so may others who have taken the Oaths. However, the Question is not, whether they have not of late receded from their former avowed Innocency; but whether their reply to a former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation was not full and to the purpose: For all Impeachments are Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, and respect matters of Fact perform'd and done, and not what are wrapt up in the Bosom of Futurity: So that if they were not guilty of what was then thought worthy to be objected to them, the Accusation was frivolous: if any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36597:18"/> of them have since bin guilty of any thing, for which they may now be Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as our <hi>Diocesan</hi> and others (we hope) are remote from such an Affliction; so the old Accusation, however, do's not Operate against any of them, unless we admit our Adversaries Cavils, which were (as was also their own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and our Address and Apology for them) published before the Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the late su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But I must return to the merits of the former Accusation, and consider it with relation to the Bishops.</p>
               <p>When the Author of an Inquiry (modest or immodest, let the Reader judge) had persuaded the World, that the then Summers Disquiet proceeded from their fatal influences on the public Affairs, the deprived Bishops, who were Resident near <hi>London,</hi> published a Declaration, to obviate the loud Calumny, and to reconcile the Scruples of more moderate Men. The Reflecter, to raise an Unchristian Jealousie in Mens minds, was pleased to make a reply, which, in effect, was nothing else (tho painted with some malicious flourishes) than that albeit they declared, as it were, open war against the <hi>French</hi> Monarch, yet they did not with the same Breath, publish a solemn Defiance against King <hi>James.</hi> But (with submission) what occasion was there at that time (when the <hi>French</hi> Fleet manned with <hi>French</hi> Seamen, and Souldiers, and Armed with a <hi>French</hi> Commission, Rod on our Coasts) of declaring against any thing but what was <hi>French?</hi> Or why must the Bishops be more forward than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who, as one of the Members, observ'd, make no mention of King <hi>James?</hi> Indeed it was then all the Noise, that the <hi>French</hi> Forces were to have made way for the late Kings Re-establishment: If, therefore the Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against the attempts of the <hi>French</hi> upon our Nation, they protested consequently; and this was all that could be required, against all the comforts the Abdicate Prince could derive from the success of that Invasion.</p>
               <p>But, there is not only ill Reasoning, but a great deal of ill Nature in this pretence of the Reflecter, which I may Illustrate by a plain and familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Put the case, a Peasant of <hi>Picardy</hi> or <hi>Champaign,</hi> in his way to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, where he is carrying some Fruit, or Provisions, be met by a Party of an adjoyning Garrison, who, without much enquiry into the Countrymans way of Life, or any other decent Ceremony, drag him before the Governor, and acqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt his Lordship, that the Peasant was surpriz'd by them, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Supplies, or Intelligence to the Confederate Camp. The poor Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests his Innocency, and yet can gain no Credit: He tells the examining Monsieur, and the Reflecting Dragoons, that he never held Correspondence with the <hi>Dutch, Spaniards, Germans,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> and that he could produce as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Proofs of his integrity as the Case would admit, and therefore prays his enlargement. The Governor, having imposed silence on the poor Man, replies sharply to him, that if this was all he could say for himself, he should certainly suffer, and so, in brief, amuses him with a Sentence after this sort. Friend, says he, thou tellest me? thou holdest no Intelligence with the Kings Enemies of this side of the Nation, but thou do'st not affirm, thou had'st never Correspondence with the <hi>Vaudois</hi> or <hi>Savoyers;</hi> so that thy Declaration is insincere, and thou shalt Die for it. Who would not cry out, <hi>O Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cessitate confusam!</hi> Who would not Condemn the malitious Injustice, and be irreconcillable to the Decree? And indeed, tho no Simile can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to run in all points an exact Parallel, the Bishops case was much the same; for being accus'd, as concurring to that Summers Enterprize of the <hi>French,</hi> they declared against that Scandal: But then some Reflecting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians replied to them, you are not to be believed on this account; for tho
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36597:18"/> you declared against the <hi>French,</hi> who were on the Coasts of <hi>Suss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x,</hi> yet you did not declare against the late King, who was then with his Army in <hi>Ireland:</hi> You declare against all the mischief that may come from the <hi>South,</hi> but you declare not against the Storm which we think is brewing in the <hi>West:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever declare what you will, even against that too, we resolve to represent you to the Nation, as People unworthy, as of Favour, so of Credit too.</p>
               <p>But let me presume so far as to examine, what crime these Bishops were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently guilty of at that Conjuncture? Was it by their Magic, that so many Ships perish'd by the Rage of Tempests and other unlucky Casualties? Did they invite the <hi>French</hi> Privateers to disturb our Commerce, and afflict our Merchants? Did they Chain up our Men of War in the Road to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> when the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet passed by in view of our Captains? Were they concerned in the unaccountable Conduct of <hi>Torrington,</hi> or in the loss the <hi>Dutch</hi> sustain'd in that sorry Engagement? Did they prevail with the Waters of the <hi>Shanon,</hi> to force our Soldiers from their Trenches before <hi>Limeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi> If neither these, nor other contrivances can be made out against them, we may reasonably conclude, that they were then bespattered, because the Father of Lies will still appear to be an Accuser of the Brethren. And 'tis no wonder he should blacken the Reputation of our Bishops, since he used the same Artifice against the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians; for if <hi>Tyber</hi> o'er-flow'd its banks, if <hi>Nilus</hi> did not refresh the Meadows, or if any other Calamities were dispatch'd by Gods appointment to scourge the Nation; the usual and popular cry was <hi>Causa Christiani, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani ad Leones;</hi> the Christians, tho innocent, were adjudged the Cause, and must therefore Die for the sins of the People.</p>
               <p>I am confident, I may (if the Reflecter please) save him the trouble of a deep research into the Mystery of our late Visitations; for the important causes of our disquiet were our many monstrous abominations; and among them the Profane and Uncharitable Spirit of our Nation: The Treachery and Avarice of our Officers, the barefac'd Vindication of former Sacrilege and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, the crying Iniquity of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Rabling; the old Confessors St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi> and the Bishops of the <hi>Nice</hi> Council have receiv'd from the Champions of a revived Heresie: Our Calamities were Gods judgments and the Effects of our own follies; the Bishops were no more concern'd in them, then <hi>Elijah</hi> in the Famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> or <hi>Innocentius</hi> in the Devastations committed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Barbarous <hi>Goths.</hi> If any of them are since liable to accusation, their offences can with as little reason be charged on the rest of their Brethren, as the particular failures of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> could be imputed to <hi>Stephen,</hi> or the other Deacons of the Primitive Church. Should all of them be equally concern'd in the guilt, this do's not however overthrow their former Innocence, and so I have done with that point.</p>
               <p>I cannot but with some pain, observe one more of the Reflecters base insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; for he gives out (as tho he was Secretary of State to the Almighty Searcher of Hearts) that the Bishops retain their Principles which Govern their <hi>Non-conformity</hi> (not in a Ceremony but) in a main point of Obedience (as to their Majesties and the Laws) so also to Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Only, I would willingly know, whether he is so Cruel against every one that is not of his mind? I believe he would not be so virulent against some, who think all Oaths unlawful: If he is kind to them, and do's bear a regard to their scruple of Conscience, why is he so unmerciful in the present Case, and why are the Bishops Prosecuted (a milder word, then truly persecuted) by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives?</p>
               <p>I confess, some Mens Consciences can serve as a Weather-Cock to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest but the iniquity of Hypocrites, ought not to be thrown into the Ballance with the scruples of godly and serious Men, which we dare not believe, are so far the effects of profligate Humour and Passion, as to put a design'd affront on the great Omniscient Judge: And truly if we entertain the checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, with a worse then Atheistical Indifference, and if by any strains of Wit, we can Interpret those pangs as Divine and Consolatory Raptures; let us no longer accuse <hi>Tallus Hostilius</hi> for placing Fear and Paleness among the Gods.</p>
               <p>I must entreat the Readers Patience, to subjoyn one more of our Authors cogent Reasons against our Petition, which I had almost forgot, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> Because His Majesty is the best of Kings, and that we have had great Experience of his Clemency.</p>
               <p>That His Majesty is the best of Kings, and that some of our Authors Party may from their great Experience, declare him to be such, we stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and do therefore admire, since they enjoy so large a share in the Benefit of the Indulgence, for which we thank'd his Majesty, they should be so invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to bethink the same Royal favour and good Will of the Subscribers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. In truth, the Reflecter has an Awkard way of arguing, for his Reasons prove much on our part. Doubtless, the Kings Clemency is the strongest Reason to induce his Subjects to Petition: The Draught of Pardon, he sent down to the Parliament, His Gracious regard to tender Consciences, the other remarkable Emanations of his favour, encourag'd us to throw our selves prostrate at his Feet, as with our hearty thanks for his many Royal Concessions, so with our humble Address for our <hi>Diocesan</hi> and his Brethren, if they thought the favour compatable with his service. In fine, the Kings known Clemency, was not so much an Argument against our Petition, as a Foundation, to ground the Hopes of his Pardon and Indulgence to us, if our Petition were displeasing to him.</p>
               <p>And truly, if I thought, that either the Proceedings of our Grand-Jury, or any thing I now propose in their Vindication, were inconsistent with the plain Honesty of a Christian, or the duty of a faithful Subject, I would readily beg Pardon of the meanest Reader; and, I may assure him, that I would never have undertaken the present task, had not some Persons assumed a plausible pretence from the circumstances of the deprived Bishops, to run out in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Excursion against our Church, and all our Bishops in general, and to ridi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Reflecter acquainted the World, that he did not see the Apology, 'till his own Pamphlet was Printed. Whether this be true or no, the Reader has the choice of his thoughts, which yet, he may soon determine, if he please to consider, that the Reflecter recited the <hi>Gloucester-shire</hi> Address in the same Numeric words, as it was abbreviated in the Apology; and, whether by this step of our Author, we may not discover what sort of Ramble he intended to pursue, is left to the determination of honest Judges. Be it, however, true or false, the Reflecter shall with freedom gain that point, and therefore, saving in the Title Page and Postscript, the Apologist do's not conceive himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; but yet to do him reasonable Justice, he has considered, as his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against our Address, so his other Malevolent Reflections.</p>
               <p>The Examiner is the Person, with whom I shall now be more immediately concerned, he having Anatomiz'd the Apology with a merciless hand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented it as Ghastly as the <hi>Gorgon-Idea</hi> of his own Malice could make it. And truly, if our Author had taken the freedom to have exposed any Errors and Impertinences of that Pamphlet, without discovering much greater Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of his own, I should have submitted to his Animadversions, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a well designed Charity: But since his own Pen has fallen into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Riot, that gives scandal to sober Men, it can be never too late, either to express an abhorrence of his proceedings, or to expose the Baseness and Treachery of his Principles.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note> the unhappiness of Men of our Profession, I mean the Clergy, whereof I have the honour to be one, that the World has in all Ages tax'd them with something of wilfulness and positiveness of humour beyond the rest of mankind.</p>
               <p>O rare Bird, thus to defile his own Nest! The Atheist (who values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for insulting on the Parsons) will thank him for the Notion, and <hi>Satan</hi> has no need to be let loose, since the Examiner do's hold the Pulpit▪ and has made it the Chair of Scorners. Indeed▪ with respect to our Author, the Imputation is not altogether frivolous, and therefore let him scall'd his Lips with a Mess of his own Broth. But the good Man seems to imply, that the VVorld hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to tax God's Messengers of wilfulness and positiveness of Humor; and 'tis no wonder this should be our Fate, since our Saviour (who himself took part
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36597:20"/> of the censure, and now suffers in his Members) assured his Disciples, that the VVorld would hate them, because they were not of this VVorld. They are obliged, by vertue of their Commission to Preach up Repentance, with all its Artillery of Sighs and Tears, and Mourning and Sorrow for sin and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Doctrines; and this is called humorsom Preciseness; they give us a dreadful Account of Death and of Judgment to come; and this surprizing Truth, which made <hi>Foelix</hi> tremble, is esteem'd the New <hi>Atlantis</hi> of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. Let the Clergy be as positive as they please, the Men of the VVorld resolve to be as wilful on the other hand, and to drown the harsh D n of their musty Morals in the Charms of pleasure: Or if our young <hi>Danites</hi> must have the formality of a Chaplain to instruct them in the way to happiness, they will admit of no other <hi>Jonathan</hi> but the Examiner. The Path he finds out, is strewed with Violets, and with the blest Luxury of bountiful Nature; the <hi>Elizian</hi> Groves, to which he directs, abound with Balmy Fountains; and the Enchanted Lover, like <hi>Absalom,</hi> is often caught up from the Earth by Trees of Perfume, whil'st their <hi>Odoriferous</hi> Fruits drop into his Mouth: This is the Country they long for, and the Examiner is the Star that leads them to it, nor will they be oblig'd to any rules of severity, since <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> have their Priest, who is more Indulgent to them. The Enemies of the Clergy (to whom our Examiner has administred a new Topic of Railery) have a blest occasion to Cant, in favour of their Lewdness: But alas! They will be sensible of their mistake, when they receive their reward, and find that the Garlands which now adorn their Temples, and crown their Cups, are too weak an Amule: against darting Flames. In the mean time, let our Clergy-man know, that what he calls an Unhappiness, one of a greater Authority has Proclaim'd to be a Blessing: For Christ says, <hi>Blessed are ye, when Men shall revile you, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, and speak Evil of you falsely for my sake; Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for so Persecuted they the Prophets which were before you:</hi> And which of the two, either our Saviour, or a Profane Clergy-man, we are to believe, let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian judge.</p>
               <p>Our Examiner, according to the Rhetors advice, has made a fair beginning, how he proceeds to carry on the Frolic, shall be the Subject of our Inquiry.</p>
               <p>He tells me in several places, that a Club of the Clergy were the Authors both of the Address and of the Apology;<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>4,</hi> &amp;c.</note> but who those Clergy-men were, he does not pretend to inform us, so that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re the world, I had no assistance from him, tho he pretends to be one of that Coat. But why must the Clergy be the Authors? Alas! the reason is plain; for our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer whose design is to blacken our Church, calls himself at present a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man on purpose to give his Brethren a <hi>Judas</hi> Kiss: for as there is no such wound as that of a Friend; so he first represents the Apology as a most wicked illegal thing, and then throws it at the Clergy's door, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world that tho they took the Oaths themselves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 7.</note> yet they are far greater Enemies to the present Settlement than those who refused them. Here is a Specimen of our Examiners Charity attending a Positive Declaration of a matter both false and malicious!</p>
               <p>Indeed were the old Law of the <hi>Persians</hi> in force among us, that for a third Lye a mans tongue should be condemn'd to silence, our Author would be never subject to the frailty of spreading any more falshoods; for besides his many vile Suggestions on other Accounts, he has repeated this ridiculous Forgery beyond that setled number of Times; and yet after the full Extravagance (and what can be more odious than a Lye?) our Examiner whipes his Mouth, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he has done no harm, especially since he thinks he has added to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Clergy.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:36597:20"/>
               <p>In Truth our <hi>Levite</hi> contrived his design to the best advantage; the Clergy must be the most wilful and the most positive part of Mankind; and then they must be the Authors of the Apology; and this last story might have past cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, if the declaration I solemnly made in the Epistle prefixt to the Apology, had not ptevented the ridiculous pretence; and indeed our Author thought it advisable not to be too curious in examining that Epistle; but bestows some Personal Refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He tells me, that the People I called a restless Faction, being Enemies to our Address, were the whole Nobility,<note place="margin">

               <p>Another thing observable in the Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I might, if it were worth while, inform the Reader, that according to the Original Manuscript the Title of the Pamphlet did directly and in express words, point to an Enquiry into the nature and tendency of the late Addresses, together with a Vindication of that which was preferred by our Grand-Jury in favour of the Suspended Bishops; but whereas the Objection is leve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are two Cheats, which lie couched in our Examiner's Question; He thereby intimates, first, that I meant a justification of their Scruples; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that I intended to publish the Reasons of their Refusal, if I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the dictates of our Examiner in these cases, I had, as he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where up braids me,<note place="margin">

Our Author was not insensible how open such a Discourse would have expos'd me, not only to his own lash, but to the public censure, and was therefore pleased to give me this fly Challenge, and to father his own wrong notions upon me, by foisting an Addition into the Title of the Apology, intimating that I frofest to Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ze for the Bishops refusal of the Oaths; but truly, as it could be no crime against the Government, to be guilty of such an Omission, so it was no wonder I did not pursue a Cause, to wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore I Answer, that the same Motives which prevail'd with the Grand jury to Address, directed me (or at least, ought to have bin my guide) to the properest <hi>Mediums</hi> in framing the Apology, what those were, have bin already publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VVhat I meant by Conscience, I need not explain, since our Examiner has been pleased to divert the Age with a new Doctrine, that apparently shews what a Consciencious Clergyman he is; for when I had informed him that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36597:21"/> some Persons did not refuse the Oaths out of Obstinacy, Pride, and Prejudice; he replies, that I was willing to teach the World how to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Names to the suspended Bishops.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> And, what our ill Natur'd <hi>Levite</hi> should mean by this pretence, I know not, unless he would be thought to Celebrate the Feasts and Sacrifices of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rcules,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old Custom of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Priests, who esteem'd it an heinous crime, to speak one good word during the whole Solemnity. Do's he think a pious and good Man do's value the uncharitable Names which the wicked VVorld, or any Clergy-men of <hi>Demas</hi>'s stamp do cast upon them? The Names are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and therefore to be dispis'd by a Christian, much more by Bishops: and if any of them be destitute of Pride, Prejudice, and Passion, they have a charitable name given them by their Conforming Brethren, and particularly by the most Reverend Primate of <hi>York,</hi> who in his learned Treatise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, gives no bad Account of such Men; and it is no matter what our Clergyman, or the uncharitable world prate against them, or against that Arch-bishop; since both the Swearing and the Non-swearing Fathers, own the same Principle in this case: And may the good God in his due time reconcile them in other Points, which is the hearty Prayer of all charitable Men.</p>
               <p>I must not forget to let the VVorld know, what serious admonition the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer offer'd to the Bishops: He advised them, since the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizers did not dive into the Reasons,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note> why the Bishops refused the Oaths, some of the Reverend Persons would have done it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by which, he says, they would have abundantly obliged the World. Here the Examiner appear'd in his true colours, and we may at first sight, guess what he would be at. How do's he know, but they were commanded by Authority to be silent? VVould it have recommended them to the favour of the best Men, or have bin introductive of Union, or advance the public se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Bishops to have publish'd the occasion of their scruples, and to have rais'd doubts in others? Should the Press be supplied with new Artillery, to Bombard our Nation, and to ruin our Peace. VVe have heard indeed, of some learned VVranglers, who would always carp at the Established Orders and Discipline, 'till they were bought of some Ecclesiastical preferments: But our late <hi>Diocesan,</hi> has bin the Son of Peace; and as he hath hitherto promoted, neither Clamour, nor Schism; so has he not thought it necessary to accept a Challenge, to which our reverend Clergyman has dar'd him.</p>
               <p>But truly I am surpriz'd to consider how a Person of so mean a soul as our Examiner should expect any satisfaction in this or any other case from men of Honour and of Conscience who, hath affronted them after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable sort:<note place="margin">

What! were all the Suspended Clergy Pentioners of Fortune? were all their Consciences subject to the Laws of the Sword, and to the Fate of War? Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has acquainted the world, That a Clergy-man may have Scruples, and yet be no Disciple of <hi>Mars,</hi> or a Friend of the unrighteous Mammon. He hath overcome his doubts without digging into the Trenches either of <hi>Colerain</hi> or <hi>Limrick;</hi> and tho he is most happy in satisfying his own Scruples, and most righteous in justifying the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Laws; yet his Integrity was not to be disputed during his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36597:21"/> But there is no great heed to be given to our Examiner, who abuses our Clergy in general. Our Suspended Clergy were sent to <hi>Ireland</hi> to fish for Consciences in the <hi>Shannor,</hi> and the Bishop and Clergy of <hi>London</hi> with many Hundreds in other Diocesses, who are not Suspended, were condemn'd by our Author to the Pest-house, they being according to the New Montebanks Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate infected with the Rot.

Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> like <hi>Joseph</hi> in <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Royal Prison, thought this no agreeable Palace; the same has prov'd fatal to Crown'd Heads; and though some of the <hi>Regalia</hi> are preserv'd in the Archives of the <hi>Tower</hi> (where they are as insensible of their confinement as of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence that is paid them by the Spectators) yet is it an usual Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of Murtherers and Traytors. In fine, as the Innocency of the Bishops was as clear as the Heavens, so would their Confinement have been as dreadful as the lowest Cell of <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s Prison had they not been supported with the Christian consideration that a good Conscience, and God's presence changes Hell into Heaven, and makes the most noisom Dungeon on Earth equal to the Paradice above.</p>
               <p>We gladly acknowledge that a good hand of Providence stopped the Popish fury in its Meridian career; so that those seven Confessors can pretend to no other Martyrdom than what they receive from Evil and Mercenary Tongues. But if we take the Testimony of the Foreign <hi>Hugonot</hi> Ministers (whose words I shall have occasion to cite more at large in another place) to be of any Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; those Fathers which were imprisoned in the Royal Palace of the <hi>Tower,</hi> were animated with a Zeal worthy Primitive Bishops, and were prepared to suffer any thing with admirable constancy; some indeed think they suffered too little, and there are a sort of Anti-Prelatists, men true neither to the

               </p>
               <p>The Examiner having by a subtile device mitigated the just Odium we had conceiv'd of the illegal Practices of the Papists against our Prelates in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution during the late Reign, he considers the Merit of the Bishops with as great equity as their sufferings; and will by no means consent that they should have come under any shadow of Favour, as Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi> once did: but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if his Theme were good, his management has spoil'd it, and his Reasons like <hi>Hercules</hi>'s foot, do soon discover their Master. He tells us (pray mark the Argument) that the Bishops were not worthy of the Priviledge, because he could not remember that either of them had the good fortune to preserve the Life of a King,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>That they should have preserved the Lives of Kings when sought for by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, would have entituled them to the Province of Guardian Angels; that they did not more especially preserve the Life of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, if they might not be imputed to the precaution of the Regicides, yet the surprize was no less afflicting to them than to the Royal Martyr, bearing in some sense an Analogy with that Agonizing love which drew a flood of Tears from St. <hi>John,</hi> and the other suffering Saints, who being the sad Witnesses of our Saviour's Passion, wept in simpathy with the blood and water that streamed from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It would be vanity in me to say they would have been ready to have died for him, since all Persons who are acquainted with their Principles, cannot but allow that they would have suffered any thing to have kept him alive, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of that Damnation which over-took his Murtherers.</p>
               <p>That they were not instrumental in preserving the Life of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second at <hi>Worcester,</hi> proceeded from the determined Council and Pleasure of God, who raised up other Instruments to effect it; the same unsearchable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reserving our Bishops for another great work to the overthrow of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to the confusion of many of those old Rebels, whose hands were scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-red at <hi>Worcester</hi> Battel; who having expell'd that King, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I might retort that the Popish Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi> was not as meritorious as our Bishops, because he was not clapt up into the <hi>Tower</hi> with, and in the cause of, those Protestant Confessors, and at the same rate our Clergy-man might evade the Character of being as great a Rayler as <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, because he did not joyn with them in their Outrage against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> but the world will not allow him such a Priviledg beyond the rest of the <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Fraternity.</p>

This is very fine! And yet, with the Examiners leave, Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi> did not stand without the honour of being a Clergyman himself: For he was a Priest, and a Priest too (if we may believe his Cant in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>) after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> Whether our unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Clergyman be of that Order, I shall not determine, but what a sort of Clergyman <hi>Huddleston</hi> was, I will consider in its due place.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, that our Author may not judge himself, and Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestone,</hi> the only meritorious Clergymen: I desire him to examine in what Language the Bishops, who writes and thinks as clearly as any Person in the Nation, Discourses of the Seven Bishops, and another reverend Prelace; he tells us, that their merits and sufferings, in asserting our Laws and Religion, were so conspicuous, and by consequence, the fury of the <hi>Papists</hi> against them so implacable, that perhaps it would be presumption in any other Clergyman to come in Competition with them, for either of those Honours: And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Discourse, the same Bishop carries on the Panegiric in an higher strain, which I know, cannot but disgust any Clergyman of our Examiners and Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi>'s principles, and therefore I shall not insist on a Theme so unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to them.</p>
               <p>I rather observe, that when I made mention of Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi>'s merit, I did not thereby suppose, that he did more then his duty: For what our Examiner says of our Bishops, we may apply to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he did not so well at one time, but he did as ill afterwards, by refusing the Oaths. And truly, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for which we Petitioned, like that which was granted to him, would have bin an Act of Grace and not of VVorks: And to deny the Kings Power, to propose such an Act to the consideration of His Parliament, was a great weakness in some Persons, and seem'd derived from the peculiar pretence of, such State-Dogmatists, as would be thought fit Tutors to instruct their Prince</p>
               <p>It cannot, I confess be denied, that an Oath is a National security; but yet, it must still be allowed, that it is therefore a security, because the Customs of the Nations hath so enacted, But this do's not bar the right of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that is lodg'd in the Legislative Body, which may appoint any other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and accept it as such: So that when I propos'd the example of Mr. <hi>Huddleston</hi> (an old <hi>Popish</hi> Priest, who, by a solemn League and Covenant taken in the Apostolic Chamber, where they usually declare in an irreconcilable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of all protestants, by them called Heretical Princes; and joyn in the dreadful Unkinging <hi>Anathema</hi> against them) was so far plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g'd into an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Precontract, as to stand in need of a Parliament to supersede the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Oaths, when I say, I propos'd this example, I did it with no other intent, then to express what power is seated in our King and Parliament, and as we were not Traitors for owning their Authority; so it is no Treason to affirm, that His Majesty in concurrence with our representatives, can at their pleasure excuse the Oaths. Should they in our case have refus'd it, upon the account, that such a performance might have bin an <hi>Ʋmbrage</hi> to the quiet and peace of the Government; they would however, as has bin often hinted, have acted according to the real sense of our Petition; for our Grand jury did not engage into any Mans Quarrel against our Establishment, the Authority of which, we own'd in express Terms; but we did, with all dutiful submission, resign the Case, wholly to be determined by our Superiors, whether the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36597:23"/> of our Address, could bear any proportion agreable to His Majesties Service. And therefore, the Examiner is too fierce, when he is pleased to say, that we presumed so far as to prescribe a Copy to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 19.</note> for, whoever consults the Page, to which he refers, may soon perceive the intent, by the very Letter of the words, <hi>viz.</hi> that as the two Houses have Presidents of their own, which in matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they often pursue (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate did usually proceed <hi>more Majorum</hi>) so that it is introductive of no new Custom, for our Representatives to Copy out their own former special Acts, if they judge it convenient; and that where such Presidents are wanting, the Sovereign (with the Concurrence of the Lords and Commons) can, on many occasions, dispense where there was never dispensation before.</p>
               <p>I confess, by some expressions in the Apology of which, I may Assign this as one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that King <hi>William</hi>'s favour to the Bishops would gain him as much Renown, as when he waded thro the difficulties of War: Any Person hath just reason to conclude, that I was too far Transported in a cause, which I thought, had not bin the worst in the world; and yet, notwithstanding the Examiners Retort, I may tell him, that as I supposed, it would have bin an Act of Mercy, so all such Acts bear an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Character then Feats of Arms; since, according to the good old Father, to shew Mercy, is greater then to raise from the Dead. 'Tis true indeed, the passing o're the <hi>Boyn,</hi> and the other renowned Exploits of King <hi>William,</hi> were most memorable Atchievements, but yet they were the Atchievments of a Man: For the like have bin perform'd by his Illustrious Ancestors, by the <hi>Carthaginian Hannibal,</hi> by the <hi>Roman Caesars,</hi> and by <hi>Henry</hi> the great of <hi>France:</hi> But to raise from the Dead, is an Act purely Divine, and carries with it the stamp of our great deliverer Christ.</p>
               <p>If I was too forward in framing my <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I am sure the Examiner has out-stript me in cases of that Nature, of which he gives no laudable Instance, when wresting my words beyond reasonable construction, he tells me, as if he were <hi>Confessarius</hi> to his Majesty, that if shewing favour to the Bishops,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 33.</note> had bin an Act of Piety, it must consequently have bin King <hi>William</hi>'s Duty so to have done.</p>
               <p>The advantage our Author would hence derive, is, that I should agree, it was King <hi>William</hi>'s duty to have extended the favor, for which we Petitioned: But I am so far from weighing the Sentiments and Actions of our great Prince (who carries the ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> in his own hands) in my narrow Scale, that I dare not affirm a thing which would render me not one of the number of humble Petitioners, but rather of wilful and positive Dictators, such as the world accounts our Examiner, by his own confession to be: However, by my saying King <hi>William</hi>'s favor to the Bishops, would have bin an Act of Piety; I meant only to express my own sense, and the sentiments of the Subscribers, upon which they grounded their Petition, tho the Examiner carps at my good manners, for not diving into the scruples of the deprived Fathers, I desire him not to presume so far, as to obtrude a private Opinion, upon the Reason and Conscience of his Sacred Majesty.</p>
               <p>I need not at present usurp so far upon the faculty of our positive Theologue, as to examine the several acceptations, by which the word Piety is distinguish'd among Authors, tho I cannot but assure our Clergyman, that if he do's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Acts of Piety to be, without respect to Circumstances, at all times the necessary Duty of a Man; I may, if he please, put him in mind of a work, that may render his Name and Character more famous then that of an Inquisitor.</p>

And dare our Examiner, <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> affirm, that the solemn parole of honour of such Fathers, is the same with the Knight-Erranty of the <hi>Alsatia</hi> Squires, who swear and forswear, who reiterate Vows and Promises al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready broken, and break and reiterate them again? This Knight Erranto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Author, is learnt from the reverend <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who is the <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophet, and the Evangelist of our Examiner. Our Clergyman has now discover'd his Reading, and why may he not be of kin to another <hi>Romantic</hi> Hero (of the same Trade with our Author) who using the necessary expedient of Penny Sermons, was pleasantly impos'd on by the Treachery of his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Lad, that pack'd up his Baggage, for by this means, he gave his Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners a surprizing account of the Divinity, contain'd in the renowned History of the <hi>Gotham Magi.</hi> We see what fate usually attends those, who have neither Honour nor Veracity to loose; and may we be delivered from all such Pulpit Drolls, whose Bible is a Romance, and whose Library is at the <hi>Mancha.</hi> In truth, our Author, to carry on the Frolique, ought to have Dedicated his Learned composure to the <hi>Saint-Errant</hi> of that holy City; he had then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly imitated the great <hi>Dominican Gallego,</hi> who having discust some Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Questions, concluded with the memorable words: And thus, saith he, <hi>I have finished the first Tome of my Logical Controversies, which I Consecrate to the Honour, and to the Glory of St.</hi> Benedict, <hi>the Gracious Patrone of the Famous Town</hi> de Yepes, <hi>where I suck'd in both my Milk and my Learning. —</hi> But to Proceed.</p>
               <p>Our Examiner was very huffish and severe, that our Bishops (and indeed most of the Bishops of our Nation are concern'd in the same guilt) should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any sorrow for the miseries of the late King, and therefore is enrag'd at their Tears for the Calamities of King <hi>James,</hi>

Our Clergyman, if he please, may consult the Sermon of the reverend Doctor, who Preach'd the last Thanksgiving day before the Commons, and he will be amply satisfied, that our Church did not rejoyce at the troubles into which King <hi>James</hi> was involv'd: <hi>We were, saith he, active in our Obedience to our Prince, as far as our Conscience would give us leave, and when he required of us more then this, we received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with sorrow, but submitted to his displeasure with good Will, with such a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian temper, with so affectionate a concern, as shewed that we were more troubled for his misfortune than for our own. —</hi> This was the summ of our Bishops Tears, and if our Clergyman was destitute of them, his Eyes were Flint, and his Heart as hard as the nether Milstone; I am sure we had no Reason to be glad at the afflictions, or the sins of the Abdicate Prince, but our joy ought rather to be employ'd in praising God for our wonderful deliverance by the hands of the present Soveraign.</p>
               <p>But the Examiner, to make the Reflection the more odious, cries out,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> what needed the Apologist tell the world, that those Fathers endeavoured by their holy Tears, to cure the unfortunate Princes wounds? Which he interprets, as a design to cure him of the loss of his Kingdom. O delicately observ'd! Had not King <hi>James</hi> any wounds before he left his Kingdom, was he not wounded in his judgment, when he spurn'd at the Lord Primates seasonable Admonition, to be reconciled to the Protestant Faith? Was he not wounded in his Government, when he refused the Bishops serious Advice, to be reconciled to his People? Was not he wounded by his false Friends, when flattering Addressors and evil Councellors, had ruined his Interest in the Nation? Our Bishops, whilst he held both the Authority and the Name of King, endeavoured to have cured him of these wounds, and at the same time, to have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36597:24"/> the just demands of our Deliverer: But, to say, they endeavoured to cure the late King of his wounds, by placing him on the Throne again, is our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman's blessed Inference, and as it was far from my thoughts, so it is as good sense as to cure the wounds of a Man, whose Soul is departed from his Body: For after King <hi>James</hi> was Dead in Law and in Policy, he could receive as little comfort from that Medicine of the Bishops, as the <hi>Egyptian Mummies</hi> can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the best Balm of that Country. But to evidence the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Cavil, the Reader need no other expedient, than to consult the Apology, and he may find, that tho some <hi>Lachrymists</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to cure King <hi>James</hi>'s wounds with their Tears,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> they were yet so far from promoting the design of his Return, that they were of an unspotted Fame, under the present settlement. These words are to be construed, with relation to the time when they were written, and our Authors Cavil against them hath a like dependence: So that I have nothing to say more to our Clergy-man on this Point, than to inform him of a Conclusion of our Law, <hi>Maledicta Expositio est quae corrumpit Textum,</hi> and to advise him not to publish any Annotations on the New Testament, lest from the Tears our Saviour spent upon <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he proves a design'd Conspiracy against <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it was no wonder our Reverend Clergy-man should be irreconcileable to Christian Tears, when even Godly sorrow did work death with him too; for he was pleas'd positively to assure us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.</note> that the Bishops were little obliged to the Apologizers in taxing them with mourning in spirit, for the miseries of the Protestant Church: Alas! how strangely, saith he, does the man accuse instead of defending the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he Apologizeth for, and what can he say worse of them than that they mourn in spirit for the miseries of the Protestant Church when the Bishops are thought to believe the Protestant Religion to be in a better condition through this late Revolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be not blasphemous Sophistry, the notions of Truth and Error are strangly confounded. Our Authors Argument runs thus, The Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is allowed to be in a better condition through this great Revolution: <hi>Ergo,</hi> nothing can be said worse than to mourn in spirit for the miseries of the Protestant Church! a very crooked consequence, that does directly derogate from Gods Justice, who has been chastizing his own people for their sins, and reflects as scurrilously on Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who to deprecate Gods wrath, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a solemn Monthly Fast to afflict our Bodies, and to mourn for the miseries of our Brethren!

               <p>I cannot sufficiently bewail the misfortune of our Age that has produc'd such wretched Preachers as our Examiner. It seems the state of the Protestant Church is such that it has no need of our mourning in spirit for her. O false
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36597:25"/> suggestion worthy the lips of another <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer! Indeed we in <hi>England</hi> have enjoy'd a lucid Interval of Peace, of Rest, and of Liberty within the Verge of our own Land, which next, to the infinite mercy of God, and the wonderful Conduct of our Deliverer, is doubtless in a great measure owing to the tears of those righteous Persons who mourn in secret for the publick Calamities. But does our Author, with a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Disdain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church all foreign Protestants? Or have they no miseries that deserve our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our Prayers or Lamentation? Are the Protestants of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and of the <hi>Lower Germany</hi> in no affliction? if so, what mean the dreadful Havock and Desolation of their Country? Are the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> in perfect Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility singing under their own Vines and Fig-trees? Why then do the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Refugees appear in all places the objects of our Charity?

Have the Protestants in <hi>Ireland</hi> been exempt from an over-flowing Calamity ever since the Revolution? The Tempest that has lately reign'd in <hi>Connaught,</hi> and the fury of the <hi>Raparees</hi> in other Provinces, have taught us the affliction of a very different Experience; the Protestant Church in general has not in our memory, nor in the Age of our Fathers known a blacker Scene of War and Devastation: Her M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis much to be regreted that the Bishops, who compiled the Fast-prayers, had not consulted and pursued our Examiner's sense, we should then perhaps have found that as Risibility is by the Logicians affirm'd to be the Property of Man, so his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Cajolory and Frolick of Laughing would have made up the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of our Church in her most solemn Devotions.

Finally I learnt it from the concurrent Vote of all Ages, and of all Churches; yea, even from <hi>Calvin, Zanchy, Martyr, Gualterus,</hi> and the <hi>Hugonots</hi> themselves; for in the Intercourse they held with our <hi>English</hi> Prelates they usually saluted them with the Title of most Holy and Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And therefore we may observe the Illuminated Judgment of our Clergy-man, who not only Libels our Living Bishops, and spits his Fury on our Church, but affronts most Venerable Antiquity, and condemns the Renowned Doctors of the Reformation. But 'tis usual with prophane Wits to hazard all rather than to lose their Jest.</p>
               <p>With the same reason our Examiner proposes his Question to me, from whence I learnt my new kind of Canting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lattery of Holy Bishops, I may also demand of him from whence he learnt the new Canting pretence of robbing them of their just Character? but I need not in this Case expect his Answer since <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> as I find him quoted by Dr. <hi>Downham,</hi> has plainly declar'd, that Heretics have learnt of the Devil not to give due Titles of Honour to Bishops. But why do I discourse to our Clergy-man of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who in his whole Discourse (the prime respect being paid to <hi>Don Quixot</hi>) quotes no other Ancient Father than <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Champions.</hi> And indeed he is not the first that has reviv'd the Credit of such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; for a late Chief Justice (another back-friend to our Bishops) when in the <hi>Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Assize,</hi> after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s defeat, he scowr'd through the West, he was observ'd as he sat on the Bench at <hi>Bristol,</hi> to mention neither Year-books, nor Statutes, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but to give us a Learned Reading of Law from a Passage of <hi>Sancho Panchae,</hi> and how nearly ally'd our Clergy-man is to that Lord Chief Justice, we may then presume to know when the Rabble of <hi>Whapping</hi> hath discover'd the Cheat that lyes hid under his Canonical Crape.</p>
               <p>I had almost forgot our Clergy-man's remarkable Cavil that<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 29.</note> Glorious Exploits belong not to them, but to the Sons of <hi>Mars.</hi> This stuff is part of our Authors Hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch, and it is as like the rest of the Pudding as one drop of Fat to another, I need not be very nice in my scrutiny to find where our Examiner learnt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for the good old <hi>Florentine (Machiavel</hi> I mean) supply'd him with the whole Notion. He assures us, that Heroick thoughts are not agreeable to the design of Christianity; that Gallantry and greatness of spirit are subverted by it, and that Religion does enervate the minds of its Votaries. But what does the great Bishop <hi>Osorius</hi> answer in this Case? He tells us, that this Objection of <hi>Machiavel</hi> is rude and base, and demands of him,<note place="margin">Osor. de Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, Christian. Lib. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>What he could see mean or despicable in Christians? if greatness of soul be required, none,</hi> saith he, <hi>are more Illustrious than good men, who contemn the gawdy Vanities of the World, and are transported by an Heavenly Rapture to such a degree of perfection as o study nothing but what is Divine and Noble, and to breath after Glory and Immortality. That even tender Virgins in their Conflicts, with the Rage of Persecutors, have manifested a daring Patience, an unconquerable Fortitude and a courage that has out-brav'd the cruelty of their Tormentors, and conquered Death in its most ghastly Attire.</hi> Hitherto has <hi>Osorius</hi> argued against the loud Impertinencies of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> by which it is apparent that though honesty be a word too spiritual for the Examiner, yet Gallantry is not too material for Christian Bishops. If our Author desires more satisfaction, let him consult St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, where he may find him saluting <hi>Rogatianus,</hi>

If our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man take a farther view and cast his eye on <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s History, and the Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologies of the Church, or give himself the leisure to peruse the Holy Scriptures,

May therefore a Bishop be permitted with the same Right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the name of an Hero as that of a Christian, nor let that Gallantry be thought material, which neither flames can scorch, nor Lions devour.</p>
               <p>I must not suffer another pleasant flight of our Examiner to pass without some serious Reflection; he acquaints us, that my saying the Austerities of an Holy Primate are Seraphical,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 28.</note> was a Monkish Expression; Any one, says he, would be inclinable to think the Person, the Author speaks of, was a Popish Bishop rather than a Protestant one. But will he accuse me of Monkery, for naming the Austerities of the Lord Primate Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</note> when he allows that my calling the spirit of <hi>Calvin</hi> Angelical, was a kind expression? Is not a Seraphim one of the Orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? And are not our <hi>English</hi> Metropolitans of as great Authority with us as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in other Countries? Shall he be an Archangel in their Churches, and shall not an Archbishop be at least a Seraphim in ours? Were <hi>Calvin</hi> himself alive he would deride our Clergy-man's Vanity, and peremptorily require him to affix an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> to his Book, and note his Passage as one of the Grand <hi>Errata</hi> to be expunged.</p>
               <p>But our Author tells us, He puts no value upon that, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church calls by the name of Austerities,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 29.</note> which they do by way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to gain Merit. Although this be very ridiculously offer'd; yet, with respect to our Clergy-man, who would not be thought to deliver any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous or indigested stuff, I shall consider the force of the Argument, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it self into this Categorical Form.</p>
               <p>To affirm that an Holy Primate is Seraphical in the Austerities of his life, is to put a value upon Austerities which the <hi>Romanists</hi> do by way of Penance, and to gain Merit.</p>
               <p>But the Apologizer affirms that an Holy Primate is Seraphical in the Austerities of his life.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apologizer does put such a value upon the Austerities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think I have just reason to except against our Author, as supposing first, that none but the <hi>Romanists</hi> put a value upon the strictest Austerities: Secondly, that the <hi>Romanists</hi> put no other value upon Austerities then mentioned by our Author: Thirdly, that to be Seraphically austere is to affect the Pageantry of a meer <hi>Romish</hi> Penance and Merit; all which is notoriously false as will soon appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He supposes that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e but the <hi>Romanists</hi> put a value on the strictest Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. In truth, our Author does not aright consider what definition the Masters of Morality have given us of Austerity out of <hi>Andronicus Rhodius,</hi> viz. That it is an habit of the soul that cannot bear any leudness either in speech or pleasure. I know not how any Person can be too diligent in avoiding that leudness, or too forward in curbing the exorbitancies of his Affections, the excess of his Appetite, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xtravagance of his Tongue. The Heathens themselves, who knew as little of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery as our Examiner seems to practise of true Christianity, have afforded us such Examples among their Philosophers, and others their great men, who put a value upon the true and genuine Austerities, as may serve to shame many Clergy men of our Examiner's stamp; I am sure they destroy the force of his argument, and that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Author supposes that the <hi>Romanists</hi> put no other value upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities than what he has mentioned. But I fear in this case, the Examiner, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his great Reading, has not observ'd what Cardinal <hi>Hugo</hi> hath left on Record concerning St.<note place="margin">Vid. Postil. in Epist. ad <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> he tells us, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was a true Seraphim, because he was fervent in Charity; that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36597:26"/> he had the six Wings of a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> which he makes Emblematical of the great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vertues and Graces: If our Clergyman please to consult that Author's harangue on this subject, he will find a <hi>Romish</hi> Cardinal vindicating the Seraphical Austeriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of St. <hi>Paul</hi> after a Protestant manner: For, he says, they were compos'd as of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Charity, as has bin already noted, so of Continency and Contempt of the World, of Patience and a well-ordered Faith, and of a perfect humility which divested the Apostle of any pretence to Merit, and threw him as an unworthy Servant at the Feet of a Crucified Jesus, and is it <hi>Popery</hi> in this sort to be like St. <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I fear our Clergyman in his transports against those Austerities, which he calls <hi>Popish,</hi> do's encourage the worst of <hi>Papists</hi> (those Grostic Libertines the <hi>Jesuites</hi>) in their Anti-christian Practices: For these new Evangelists instead of following the example of the great Apostle of the Gentiles in their Conversions, covered the Face of our Religion with an abominable Paint: An example of which we may learn from their proceedings in <hi>China,</hi> wherein a certain Catechism Publish'd by them, they discoursed nothing of a Crucified Christ, nothing of mortification, nothing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Austerities; so that if those deluded People should ever have the Gospel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to them, they would think themselves impos'd on, and tell the World that their Masters the <hi>Jesuites</hi> gave them no such account of Holy Tears or Mourning in Spirit, nor of a Fasting Religion, nor of a Penitent Faith, so uneasie to Nature and so repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ant to Flesh and Blood; nor of a Saviour Crucified spit upon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by Men: But rather as he had bin represented to them by the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> like one of their own plump Courtiers, pleasant, smooth and gay, shining rather with a youthful Vermilion then with an Angelic, or rather the Dinvine unmixt purity.</p>
               <p>The account we have from <hi>Johannes Palafox de Mendoza,</hi> a Bishop in <hi>America,</hi> and Dean of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He wrote an Epistle to <hi>Innocent X.</hi> of this hard usage.</note> who for exposing this Mystery of Iniquity, was thrown out of his Episcopal See by the <hi>Jesuites</hi> means: For those good Fathers prepared a <hi>Letany</hi> [from Bishop <hi>Palafox,</hi> good Lord deliver us] and cast him forth of the City, having first affix'd two Bulls-Horns upon him in the form of a Cross: This sad Fortune befel the Austere Bishop, and 'twas great pity he had not drop'd into our Clergymans Lap, who hath frankly declared himself so very kind to Persons of that high Character in the Church, that if he found a Bishop in the act of Adult'ry, he would throw his Mantle over him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 5.</note> Our Author, I believe, would in this Case, have bin the more willing to have covered him (tho not with the wings of a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> yet) with his Mantle, and to have stopp'd his Mouth with it too; least he should have pratt'led any more on the unlucky subject of Austerities, upon which the Examiner puts no great value.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to the other supposition, that Angelical Austerities (and these we know are contradistinct to all Diabolical impulses) necessarily incline to <hi>Romish</hi> Merit and Penance, and altho, what I have already said, may sufficiently rescue Austerities from the <hi>Popery</hi> of Merit, yet I would propose this Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether that habit of the Soul, which cannot bear any leudness, either in Speech or Pleasure, approaching very near the Purity of the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> in whose sight all such leudness is by Nature abominable, be of the same Mould with the <hi>Monkish</hi> Doctrines that derogate from the satisfactory Attonement and Merits of our Saviour? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Seraphims</hi> abhor the Doctrine, and our Author was not fervent in Charity, when he offer'd such a perverse insinuation.</p>
               <p>As to the matter of Pennance, I suppose Seraphical Austerities to be vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it; because Penance (or Penitence) consisting in an holy Revenge upon our Bodies, and which indeed, abstracted from the superstitious abuses, with which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has corrupted it, was the practice of true Penitents in the purest Ages, proceeds from a just and sensible sorrow of sins committed, or duties neglected, of which affliction a <hi>Seraphim</hi> is not capable, nor is it the constant imploy of a good
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36597:27"/> Christian, as Austerity is the due exercise of which is ever attended with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of a good Conscience, and the other blessed <hi>Praeludiums</hi> of that unspeakable complacency, which the Angelic Spirits Eternally enjoy, under the immediate Emanations of the Divine Love.</p>
               <p>And now, I desire our Examiner to inform me, why are not Protestant Bishops to imitate <hi>Seraphims</hi> or other good Angels, yea, even God himself in the Purity of their Lives?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philo</hi> de Gygant.</note>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> (who was before the days of <hi>Popery</hi>) assures us, that the true Priests and Prophets of God, are of a greater dignity, then to be accounted the Citizens of this world, and that as they are more sublime then to be entangled with sensible pleasure; so do they partake of an Heavenly Character, and lodge their affections among the pure and incorruptible Spirits: Nor was St. <hi>Jerome</hi> insensible, either of the practice, or of the pleasure of it when he called God to Witness most solemnly after he had fasted and prayed, and used other mortifications for several whole weeks together, that in the end, he seemed to himself to converse familiarly with Angels. But what need further Testimony derived from former times? For if, as we have bin taught by the reverend Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in his practical Discourse of Death, the only way to cure the fear of it, is to mortifie all Love and Affection to this World, and to accustom our selves to the work and to the pleasure of Heaven: If by the same Authority we are instructed, that Saints and Angels are the Heavenly Quire, with whom the Souls of good Men are to mingle here, and to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rse hereafter: I would be resolv'd, whether the Church Militant, especially, those whom the Holy Ghost is pleased to call the Angels of the Churches, and who, according to the Opinion of some of the Ancients, have two Guardian Angels attending them, ought not to joyn with those Glorified Spirits, even in this World, in Dedicating their Actions to God's Service, as well as in praising his Name? If our Examiner hath discovered a different Inclination among the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> I would advise him at the next Edition of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> to favor the Age by way of Supplement or Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, with a brief relation of his Voyage into the <hi>Etherial</hi> Countries, and let us know what escaped the observation, or at least the Pen of the old Impostor <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have sufficiently exposed the Examiners designs against the true Discipline of the Spirit, I now proceed to the consideration of some of his other remarkable hints.</p>
               <p>And truly, it is no wonder that our Clergyman, who has Preach'd a very surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Doctrine against all Bishops in general, should sliely mannage for the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worst sort of Dissenters: This our positive Author has done, and at the same time endeavoured to palliate a Crime into the guilt of which some of them were too deeply engaged. But he cannot, it seems, be kind to his beloved Friends without his usual method of falsifying against me, and therefore he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the World,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 30.</note> that I reflected on all the Dissenters in general. If I am to understand the words according to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s (that great <hi>Civilian</hi>) notion of a general Term, I must have directed my Discourse against Dissenters of all kinds, of all Orders, of all Conditions and Ages. This perhaps in some sense might have humored our Examiner, and also gratified those Dissenters, who deserv'd the lash of a severer Pen than mine, for Companions are sometimes pleasing, even to a Malefactor on the Gibbet. But if our Examiner would remove his blind-side from the Apology, he might, if he please, take notice of a necessary and just distinction between our Moderate Dissenters and other Pharisaical Men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 10.</note> whose insults on the success of our Address made me examine their own that were accepted by King <hi>James:</hi> I was so far from the conceit of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a general censure on Dissenters, that I defie an exact Critic, to find any thing of that tendency in the whole Book. However, the respect I bear to the best Men of that perswasion, must not reconcile me to the grose Immortalities, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable Conduct of others of their Brethren: For would our Examiner perswade us to comply with the Follies, the Illegal or rather Unchristian Practices of those,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36597:27"/> who expect Charity from others, whilst they themselves entertain but little in their own Breast? Or must we be traduced for laying down plain matters of Fact, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their Enemies for speaking the Truth, and for delivering the former sense of their present Majesties, of our Brethren of the Foraign Reformed Churches, and of our best Protestants at home? Whoever do's read the Letters, Declarations and Discourses, which were published against the late Stratagems of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and their Friends, will soon find as the absur'd motions of some Dissenters in King <hi>James</hi>'s time; so also that I was not the first who touch'd their folly to the quick.</p>
               <p>If we cast our Eye on a serious Letter which the <hi>French</hi> Refugees (<hi>Hugonot</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in <hi>Germany</hi>) dispatch'd to their Brethren in <hi>London</hi> that complyed with the mischievous practices of some of our Dissenters, in approving the Declaration of Indulgence as the Voice of Heaven, Peace on Earth, good Will towards Men; we may judge, whether I deserve as ill treatment from other Persons, as from the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We may also judge, whether our Author has discovered a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Temper, when he says,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 9.</note> it was no wonder that poor People should be somewhat tempted with Liberty and Exemption from the severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Penal Laws (he should have added and to have Addrest for their repeal) and even to thank the hand that gave them that Liberty, tho it was not with all the necessary conditions of Law: Which in plain <hi>English</hi> is, tho it Clothed the Prince with the Power of Dispensing, in Defiance of Parliaments, with Tests and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes solemnly Established, and also lead, as in a direct road, to the certain and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable ruin of the Protestant Interest. I would intreat impartial Judges, to consider the Import of the following words, which, among many others, of a like significancy, are to be found in the aforesaid Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we may be, say they, permitted to tell you freely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>what our Opinion is concerning the Conduct of the Bishops, and of the Dissenters in this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, we shall make no difficulty to pronounce in favour of the former: We look upon it, that they have exceedingly well answered the duty of their charge, whilst despising their own private Interest, they have so worthily supported that of the Protestant Religion, whereas the others for want of considering these things as they ought to have done, have given up the Interest of their Religion to their own particular advantanges. — How have those Venerable Prelates now highly justified themselves from the reproach that was cast upon them, of being Popishly affected; and not only of Prosecuting Dissenters, but of a secret hatred to the Reformation? How well have they made it appear, that these were only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies invented by their Enemies, to render them odious to the Protestants, and that their Hearts were truly fixed to the Reformed Religion, and animated with a Zeal, worthy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Bishops? Could you see these faithful Servants of God disobey the Order of their Soveraign, expose themselves thereby to his disgrace, suffer Imprisonment, and prepare themselves to suffer any thing without admiring their Constancy, and being touched with their Examples? But above all, could you resolve by your Conduct to condemn that of those generous Confessors? Is this the acknowledgment which you ought to have made to them for their Charity with which they received, and comforted you in their Exile,</hi> &amp;c. After this sort do these good Ministers proceed, from which we may Collect, that as our <hi>English</hi> Bishops have bin thought worthy some honour among Foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; so those Dissenters who thanked the Hand that gave them their Liberty against Law, were esteemed betrayers of their Religion.</p>
               <p>A Fancy the Examiner may be apt to tell us, that this Encomium which the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>-Ministers published in favour of the Bishops, is somewhat too Poetical, and he will be ready to direct those Forreigners, for better instruction, to a passage of his learned Book, where he hath bin pleased to signifie,<note place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36597:28"/> and other necessaries of a Camp, all of them thrice as big as the ordinary sizes to be made, and all this forsooth, that succeeding Ages might believe the Men and Horses of his Army were of a Gygantic bigness: But that</hi> Alexander <hi>by this piece of Vanity, did rather detract from his fame then and to it, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that instead of persuading after Ages of the Gygan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic bigness of his Men and Horses, he thereby gave occasion to them to doubt of their due proportion.</hi> This story with all its furniture, our Clergyman applies to an innocent representation of our Bishops Sufferings, for delivering their just sense of the <hi>Popish</hi> Declaration in the last Reign; and no doubt but he may offer the same Paraphrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Descant on what the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Divines have published in praise of those Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Confessors, and he will be apt to tell them, that our Bishops did but their Duties, and that they aggravate beyond measure, the bravery of their Conduct, and the hardships of their Imprisonment; so that in after times, People will have occasion to doubt of the proportion.</p>
               <p>Indeed our Clergyman has a prompt Genius at Application, and therefore may he not be displeased, if I lead him to a thorough compresension of the merit of some Addressers, by giving him a short story that occurr'd in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Pope</hi> sent Cardinal <hi>Campegio</hi> with a full Authority, to inquire into the Cause of the Divorce, which that Prince had endeavoured to sue out at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Legate</hi> at his entrance into <hi>London</hi> might be more magnificent then that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> into <hi>Rome</hi> was provided with a Lordly Equipage: But as he passed through <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> some of the Mules, to the great trouble of their Master, cast of their Sumpters, and the Cardinals Treasure which was thought to have equalled the Gawdery of the pretence was discovered, to consist of old Shooes, torn Raggs, tattered Britches, and other such like Stuff, which raised no small laughter in the People.</p>
               <p>How agreeable was this Pompous Pageantry to the pretences of some Protestants, who in the late Reign, Addrest with thanks, and delivered very Elaborate Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics in favour of a Declaration, that tended to the ruin of our Church? They co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Evil Intent or Folly (call it by what soft name you please) with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Charity, and with the glorious Fiocco of Liberty, and of Conscience. But as the <hi>Babilonish</hi> Beast, thus bravely Array'd, took its Journey through the Nation; it's upper Garment was pull'd off by some of our Bishops, and then the inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Monster appear'd: For the Furniture that was lodged in this <hi>Trojan-Horse,</hi> were the torn Shooes and Boots of the old Cause intermix'd with a parcel of old Slippers that had drop'd from the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Foot. There were long black ragged Cloaks, joyn'd in Affinity with <hi>Popish</hi> tatter'd Vestments: there were <hi>Agnus</hi>'s <hi>Dei,</hi> Crucifixes, consecrated Daggers, and other <hi>Italian</hi> Trumpery pack'd up with some <hi>North</hi> Country Ware; and truly the Nation could not but be surprized, to see so much Cheat set of with such a Religious Veil; and it was no wonder, that Foreign Protestants following the example of our Prelates, should express their Zeal against such false Brethren, which speak half in the Language of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and half in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Exiled <hi>Hugonots,</hi> were not the alone Prophets that lift up their Voice, as a Trumpet in abhorrence of the proceeding: But their present Majesties, before their accession to the Crown, signified their displeasure in the same Case. Give me leave to repeat what a reverend Author (who wrote the Representation of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) has laid down observable on this account. His Royal Highness,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 32.</note> said he, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being desired to approve the Suspension of the Test-Acts, was pleased to answer, that while he was, as well as profest himself, a Protestant, he would never act so unworthily as to betray the Protestant Religion, which he necessarily must, if he should do as he was desired: Her Royal Highness had the same apprehension of the tendency of the Toleration and Indulgence, and was therefore pleased to say to some <hi>Scotch</hi> Ministers, who waited upon Her, that She greatly commended their having no accession to the betraying of the Protestant Religion, by their returning home to take the benefit of the Toleration.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:36597:28"/>
               <p>We have heard their present Majesties Sentiments, and the Author from whom I coppied it, make an Emphatical Reflection on it with respect to the Addressors of that time. What an indeleble Reproach, saith he, will it be to a Company of men, that pretend to be set for the defence of the Gospel, who stile themselves Ministers of Jesus Christ to be found betraying Religion through justifying the Suspension of so many Laws, whereby it was established and supported, and whereby the Kingdoms were fenced about and guarded against Popery, whilst these two noble Princes (to the neglect of their Interests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) signify'd their open dislike of that Act of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the same Author is more plain with them, when he affirms, that though he thinks a Toleration may be due to the Dissenters Principles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 38.</note> yet he did not know whether the particular men of those Principles, who had by their Addresses betray'd the Kingdom, might not be judg'd to have forfeited all share in it for their Crime committed against the Constitution, and the whole Politick Society. Nor is there, saith he, any thing more just and equal than that they who surrender and give away the Rights both of Legislators and Subjects should lose all grace and favour from the former, and all portion from the latter.</p>
               <p>I suppose any one who is not altogether govern'd by a Malevolent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will soon allow that the tender Reflection I made upon this Affair came short of the many deplorable Instances which others have given us of that. He that does peruse the several ingenious Discourses that bare the Title of the 14 Papers may soon discover the whole Tract of the Proceeding; and if ever any Age produc'd such Mercenary Creatures to impotent and arbitrary Licentiousness I shall subscribe to our Clergy-man's Sense, and will also confess that the times might afford a softer Theme than what may be reasonably expected from the mutual Caresses of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tyranny, and of a sanctify'd Slavery.</p>
               <p>Our Examiner says, <hi>Those men were to be pitied as well as condemn'd in going any length to satisfie a Popish Prince for their deliverance from the Clutches of a Party that had made them the Butt of their Anger for many years.</hi> I do acknowledg they were to be pittied for betraying their Religion,<note place="margin">

But does the Examiner think that tho we can be charitable to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we must indulge their Errors, and be favourably inclin'd to a trick of Revenge. I may tell him that supposing they were Persecuted at the utmost rigor, and with a Severity equal to that of <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s times, they have lost the glory of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, by endeavouring an enlargement after so mean, so base, and so unjustif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It has been observ'd by others that even in point of Secular Interest they were to be blam'd; and therefore I thought that the Fate which an old Mythologist writes, befel the Camel, might express what favour the betrayers of our Church could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a Popish Prince. And I may assure them, that a Camel can sooner go through the eye of a Needle, than those Persons evade the Moral Application of that Fable: The Examiner therefore seeing himself and his Party so hard-prest, is horn-mad, and endeavours to rub off the scandal upon others; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his usual Charity he retorts the Reflection upon my self,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:36597:29"/>
               <p>But the Examiner's folly, or rather Prevarication is no less observable than his Rage, for when I had inform'd him, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> cropped the Camel's Ears for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming so far on his Interest with the Gods above other Beasts; and that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing Protestants could reasonably expect no better quarter from a Jesuited Court, on whose Golden Promises they built very fantastical hopes as of surviving the Ruin of our Church, so of obtaining strange advantages to the Reformation: Our merry Clergy-man (not without an extraordinary fit of Laughter, which in Fury as <hi>Pliny</hi> observes is a mortal sign) that I reflected on the Crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear'd Preachers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 26.</note> Truly I did expect since our Examiner took upon him to render my meaning, that he would at least have been so fair an Interpreter as not to have offer'd violence to the natural sense; and indeed I see no necessity he had of consulting the Ancient Rabbins of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Kirk, or to have told us that those weak and superstitious men did keep their Hair short cut to avoid scandal. He cannot but know in what sense the cropping of the Ears is used by the Vulgar, without the help of the Mythological or the Hieroglyphick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and I suppose our Clergy-man may have read what the Professors of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Mecha</hi> have observ'd in their Annotations on the <hi>Turkish</hi> Gospel; how that, among other things, they tell us that the ancient <hi>Arabians</hi> did usually cut off the Ears of some Beast, and then send it into the Desart for the Expiation of their Crimes (this Ceremony it seems past current with them for a sufficient Equivalent instead of holy Tears, mourning in Spirit, or the Popery of Austerities) but truly the Crimes of our Country-men could not admit of such an easie Penance; for if His Majesty, whom God raised up to destroy the Popish <hi>Hydra,</hi> had not timely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded to the rescue of our Religion and Liberties from the Clutches of a party that made them the Butt of their anger for many years, our treacherous friends of the Reformation (who depended so much on the <hi>Italian</hi> favour) would have been their own personal Scape-goats; they would without a figure have lost their Ears, if not their Heads, with their Religion and Liberties; and if the Torment of life had been continued to them, they would have been driven with reproach enough from their promis'd <hi>Canaan</hi> into the howling Wilderness; but I shall insist no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this unpleasant Subject since as they were much to blame, so it is not to be doubted but future Histories will lash the Extravagance of those time-servers, who barter'd their Birth-right in exchange for a Mess of Pottage prepar'd in the Jesuits Kitchin. I have hitherto followed our Author in his Vindication of the Addressing Dissenters; it may not be unseasonable to consider in what sort he compounds on their behalf with his Reader on other scores, and in the first place, I cannot but observe our Examiner's surprize to hear a Man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon our Dissenters in general (he is pleased to use a certain Scurrility in the Term) to speak favourably of <hi>Calvin.</hi>

               <p>I have many things in this case to reply, and among others that I believe were <hi>Calvin</hi> in our Country as he could not be of the Party of all our Dissenters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; so neither would he be a Dissenter from our Church: and that this is more than a conjecture may be learnt from foreign Protestants, who have been train'd up in his School; for tho they submit to their own Models at home, yet they judge very honourably of our Discipline.

The word Transformation (however proper on other accounts) do's sound harsh and offensive in Ecclesiastical as well as Civil Regulations, and as our Church did not Relish the notion, so did it, and not without reasonable caused, isgust the most moderate Persons in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>Thuanus</hi> was irreconcilable to such violent heats in the matters of Religion, and yet the same Author did encline favourably to moderate Reformers, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36597:31"/> from the Character bestowed by him on the good <hi>Melancton,</hi> of whom he speaks by way of hearty commendation, by being Governed by such a peacable and serene temper, as to be constant to the Opinion, that there ought to be no conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but for necessary things; and he further adds, that <hi>Melancton</hi> by his earnest avoiding all strife and contention, tho he could not escape the Reproaches of some of his own Brethren, yet he often experienc'd the humanity of strangers, and the good Will even of many who were not of his Judgment.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Calvin</hi> was altogether of <hi>Beza</hi>'s Opinion, is needless to inquire, but that he was sometimes too fond of his own Works, and too free in his Censure, do's indeed appear from his own writings: For he often spends his thoughts as a Plenepoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary Dictator, and proceeds so far as to accuse some Foreign Protestants (the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians</hi> I suppose he means) for allowing themselves to be called the <hi>Evangelici,</hi> not considering that the first Reformers did, in opposition to the <hi>Romish</hi> Traditions, and the <hi>Monkish</hi> Legends glory in the Name, and in the Reproach of Gospellers. <hi>Calvin</hi> indeed, had to do with a rough and ungovernable People at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the reason which mov'd him to be so earnest in the Establishment of his Model, was, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, out of <hi>Beza,</hi> for that he saw how needful those Bridles were to be put into the Jaws of that City. The judicious Mr. <hi>Hocker,</hi> who cites that passage, and speaks very favourably of <hi>Calvin</hi> (tho he convinces our home-bred <hi>Mimic Calvanists</hi> of dangerous mistakes and mischievous Practices) tells us, that what <hi>Calvin</hi> saw to be requisite for the People of <hi>Geneva,</hi> was by as great wisdom compassed; but he subjoyns, that wise Men, are Men, and the Truth, the Truth; and what <hi>Calvin</hi> did for the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of his Discipline, seems more commendable, than that which he taught for the countenancing of it Established; I may add, or for the countenancing of it, with Derogation to our <hi>English</hi> Reformers. This censure may be suppos'd to carry no great Prejudice with it, if we Reflect on <hi>Calvin</hi>'s proceedings, during the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> when though he acknowledged the things he thought most unfit in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> (then used by our Exiles, who resorted thither in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days) were tolerable, and declared for his own part, how easie he was to yeild in all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, such as External Rights are, yet was he too fierce and too partial an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator, or at least, suffer'd himself as one not well verst in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> (which he endeavoured to accomodate to his own Model, and that not in <hi>England,</hi> but at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> where his Orders were not disputed) to be misinform'd in the Relation of the business, and, as appears by <hi>Calvins</hi> Letter to Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and others, in which, among other Concessions, he Recants his former sharpness against our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> he expresses his satisfaction for the use of it.</p>
               <p>This instance, and indeed others which might be produc'd, do, I confess, prove that <hi>Calvin</hi> (tho he cannot in reason be alledg'd to justifie the Practices of our Dissenters) did not pay an equal respect to our <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Ceremonies as to his own: But as they shew the Charity of our <hi>English</hi> Divines, in corresponding with him in Love and Affection; so do they likewise, in some sort, betray the wretched Malice of our false Brethren, who, in those early times, which since, has bin the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is no Question to be made, but that any such Person as <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> the <hi>Scotch-Man,</hi> may have Ranchor and Rhetoric enough to Calumniate our Church abroad, and to have a d sired success among undiscerning Men; but the Bate do's not always take with the more Learned and Judicious: For Hypocrites and Defamers are so far honest, as sometimes to over-act their parts, and then the Wolfs Paw do's extend it self through the borrowed Fleece. Monsieur <hi>Goyon,</hi> who himself was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

That he ever imagined them to have bin a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that followed the same Order as the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> but, it seems, saith he, they are far from it, and their Description shews them to be a strange Party, not fit to be tolerated. How Monsieur <hi>Goyon!</hi> Are the Martyrs of Peace, are the sober and the self denying Men not fit to be tolerated? What is then to be done in the Case? In short, the Monsieur conceived, that the best remedy was to reduce them to the Episcopal Government, and that otherwise he held it impossible, the Church of <hi>England</hi> should be ever quet, or flourish. Certainly, if the Dissenters have a just ground for their Separation, the <hi>French Calvinists,</hi> with our Examiner and the rest of the Clergy, make up the most wilful and positive part of Mankind: And tho I expect a worse Title from them my self, because I dare speak the Truth, yet, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but expose the Malicious Artifice of such vile misrepresenters, as many of them are, that Hunt in Couples with the <hi>Roman</hi> Foxes.</p>

Our Church does not dispute <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Jurisdiction in his Consistory at <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor has she at any time interrupted the Synodical Interviews at <hi>Charenton,</hi> or <hi>la Rochelle,</hi> but she does not like, that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s ashes, like those of <hi>Samuel,</hi> should be subject to Charms, or that after so many years rest he should speak from the <hi>Tripos</hi> of a <hi>Westminster</hi> Assembly. And truly albeit <hi>Calvin</hi> had long before resign'd his Breath, yet the Covenanting Presbyters who borrowed the Title of his Authority to justifie their bold Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures punish'd his Memory in a viler sort than the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did their Malefactors, whom they confined to the embraces of a putrid Carcass; though <hi>Calvin</hi> was dead, yet his Writings did speak, and speak aloud to the confusion of those merciless In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators; and therefore our Church may with just reason be suppos'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more honourable thoughts of <hi>Calvin</hi> than our Separatists have done, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him with a false Gloss, and most grosly pervert his sense.</p>
               <p>The clamor of our Dissenters has enforc'd our Clergy to deliver their minds with freedom, and to say that <hi>Calvin,</hi> however learned and pious, however zealous and constant for Gods service, was not only a man, but subject to passions and to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors too. They were indeed willing to believe that his Ecclesiastical Scheme, by which he excluded Bishops from a just Jurisdiction, was rather a matter of force than of choice; but since some men perswade us, 'twas his Principle not only to advance the Aerian Parity of Presbyters and Bishops at <hi>Geneva,</hi> but to banish both the name and the office of Bishops from other Reformed Churches, where they were allowed and established, our Clergy have thought it no crime either to oppose that Levelling design, or to confirm their People in a right judgment by necessary Arguments. This gave occasion to many Learned and good men, who were not in all points of Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s judgment, to deliver their thoughts very freely of the Foreign Protestants; thus Archbishop <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> who as Dr. <hi>Par</hi> observes, declared

So that after all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. pag.</hi> 7, 8.</note> as the Reverend Doctor hopes, this Question, whether Episcopacy be <hi>ordo</hi> or <hi>gradus,</hi> will prove only a difference in words rather than substance, between those of the Lord Primate's Judgment, and those of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> since they are both agreed in the main Points of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between them and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Bishops were Ordained in the Church by the Apostles themselves, from the direction, or at least approbation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself, being the Stars which St.</hi> John <hi>saw in his Vision in our Lord Christ's own hand, and that they are permanent immutable Officers in the Church, which cannot subsist without them, but in cases of pure necessity, and lastly that those Presbyters which in Churches founded and setled with Bishops, do separate from them are guilty of Schism,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The charge of Schism is very grievous; but yet we see that <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> tho a Person of a moderate Spirit, and a sincere Charity towards <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Brethren, hath charg'd some Persons with it.

               <p>But the Examiner, when I said, that any one who is a sworn Defender of Mr. <hi>B—rs.</hi> and of <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi>'s Description of Episcopacy can never be charitable to Bishops, because they are Bishops, is pleased to smooth up the business by retorting, that there are others of the other side (our Clergyman means of the Episcopal Party) nothing behind him in Invectives against the Dissenters.<note place="margin">

               <p>But the Dissenters have great reason to be very thankful to our Clergy-man, as for his many other favours to them, so for telling us that<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Our Author, who in one Page has been pleas'd to gratifie the Dissenters, in the next does express vexation of mind against another sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. What Ridiculous stuff, saith he,<note place="margin">

How did the <hi>Leviathan</hi> dash our Shores? How did <hi>Behemoth</hi> bellow against that famous <hi>Casuist?</hi> But has the exploded stuff bin again Revived in the two last Reigns? Why, all that can be said in the Case, is briefly thus; Several Thousands very Orthodox and Loyal Clergymen (many of whom were formerly Sequestred by the Religious Rebels that worried their King to Death, sparing not the Majesty of his Crown, nor regarding the Authority of his Tears) thought it their Duty to encourage, and to Preach up a Doctrin in the days of King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> II. which they conceived might Defend these Prince, from the like Insults of Sacrilegious Men. Besides, this old Tool is much in Vogue among King <hi>William</hi>'s best and most faithful Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jects of the Clergy; and I dare believe, that the <hi>London</hi> Divines (so much Celebrated over all <hi>Europe</hi> for their Learning and Integrity) have often occasioned vexation to our Author on the same account, if he has either frequented their Churches, or pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>used their Printed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by which they have conveyed their Opinion to us. Their Learned Pens have secured the Doctrine from the Cheats and Juggles of designing Men: And dare our Examiner in favour to the Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem Martyrology</hi> affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, that the Doctrine has bin exploded by the best Men? Where are the Thousand he brags of? They are no doubt of the same Invisible Society, that Compos'd the old Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the Parliament. Very few, either of our <hi>English</hi> Bishops, or their Clergy are of the number: And, must they therefore be accounted Non-resisting Rebels to God and their Country, because they boldly assert a Primitive Truth? What shall we think of the Testimony of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> who in his late incomparable Sermon before the Commons,<note place="margin">19. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1690.</note> who, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, were as competent Judges of Truth and Error as our Author adventured to declare against this principle of the Examiner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Doctrine of Obedience to Kings,</hi> saith he, <hi>has bin so frequently discussed of late, so Learnedly demonstrated, and so undeniably Establish'd among us, that there is no need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on it. Only give me leave to say, that notwithstanding the unreasonable Cavils of gain-saying Men, yet Passive Obedience always was, and I hope always will be, the Doctrin and Practice of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>I am sure 'tis a Doctrine of which no Church need be ashamed, and no King be afraid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose our Examiner do's take himself to be loudly affronted by this great Chaplain, and it must strangely disorder his Pulse, that the Dr. should presume to Preach in a Dialect so repugnant to his Sentiments: And indeed, how could our Parliament suffer him to keep the Pulpit in Prejudice of our Examiner? Or desire that Sermon to be Printed without his especial <hi>Imprimatur</hi> affix'd to it? Certainly our Examiner will be apt to give them the same Character as he has bin pleased to pass <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olante manu)</hi> on the whole Body of the Clergy, and tax them with some thing of wilfulness and positiveness of humour beyond the rest of Mankind, nor will he be afraid to tell them, that they may play the Fool as much as they will about this old Tool, since it has bin exploded by his and a Thousand other better Pens.</p>
               <p>In truth our Examiner is very manerly, and cares not whom he affronts that thwarts his Humour. But why must <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> be an old Tool? Is it because some of the <hi>Non-Swearers</hi> are as much inclined as formerly to the Doctrin? Then the King need not be afraid of it: Is it because our Bishops and others Practis'd it in King <hi>James</hi>'s days? Of this our Church need not be ashamed: Is it because it was derived from the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles? It is then old I confess, but not a Tool: But if our Author please to consider, he may on second thoughts, find it (if rightly stated) to be no such Enemy of Self-preservation, nor to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36597:35"/> maintenance of our Natural and Civil Rights. We may Petition, we may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Remonstrate, we may make use of the Laws to gain our Repose, we may provide for our selves by Flight, or accept of a Deliverance, when we are truly convinc'd that the Providence of God do's hand it to us. This I think is our Case under King <hi>William</hi>'s Government, to whom as I have Sworn, so do I esteem him the Messenger of the great God to secure us: And as St. <hi>Peter</hi> thought it his Duty to be Obedient to the Angels that was dispatch'd from Heaven, to give him enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so do we, who have taken the Oaths, judge it our Duty to accept of a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance that has bin attended with a Chain of wonders.</p>
               <p>However, as we are not so Fanciful, to expect a continuation of Miracles, when the great work of our temporal Redemption is once fully compleated, or to suppose every thing to be Gods Immediate Call, whereby Men usually flatter the interest of their corrupt inclinations, so must we be cautious what we attempt in points of such Nicety. Tho <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had by the same miraculous Power of God, an opportunity as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> to have escaped out of Prison, yet they did not make use of that pretence of Providence, least they should have brought a scandal on the Christian Church. Their Bonds and Chains did indeed drop off their Bodies, and the Gates flew open, but they had no direct order to quit their Stations, and they chose rather to remain confin'd, tho against Law and Custom, which Entituled the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> to better Priviledges, than to hazard the Honour of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Life of their Keepers. In short, tho Liberty be a thing natural for Men to crave, and suffering a circumstance no ways desireable, yet we must not go out of Gods Road to obtain the one, or to avoid the other.</p>
               <p>But our Clergyman seems to Reflect on the Writings, Sermons and Practices of some Persons, who in the late Reign, made a wrong interpretation of the Doctrin, and yet, this is very little to his purpose, as will appear, if we in brief summ up his Argument. Let us therefore observe the grand stroke of the Consequence, <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> has bin misapply'd by wrong Interpreters (let us also so far gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Examiner, as to place the Apologist among them) <hi>Ergo, Passive Obedience</hi> is an old Tool! This is finely concluded; and by the same Rule we may proceed, and say, The Scribes of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> depraved the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> by their foul Glosses, <hi>Tresilian de la Zouche,</hi> and other Judges, abused our Laws by corrupt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Arrians</hi> perverted the sense of the Apostolic Records; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Law and the Gospel are an old Tool. At this rate, we may burn our Statutes, throw our <hi>Bibles</hi> into the Flames, and be guilty of the worst sort of slavish Resignation, and remain silent, and mute, whil'st the young Tool of a Clergyman do's Preach against Righteousness and Truth, and bids the common People beware of all such Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Sermons, which do not allow of an actual Resistance, when he or his Friends blow the Trumpet for the good Old Cause.</p>
               <p>I have in some sort considered the Principles of our Examiner, both as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Religion, and Civil Discipline, but it would fill a Volum to describe his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according to his real and intrinsic Merit. His own words are a sufficient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, and therefore, we cannot think he do's pretend to much Sanctity, for he would then be the greatest Invective against himself. Indeed, be he what he will, he hath in part discover'd his shapes, and we thank him for the Favour. And, truly at what Random his faculty do's bolt, may appear from the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he puts on harmless expressions; for when I discours'd of Christian Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Afflictions, and proved that by this Principle, the Suspended Bishops could not encourage their Friends (be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y never so many) to any Seditious Practices against the present Government; he answers, I should do well to leave out such bragging Threats: Agreable to which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 32. <hi>Pag.</hi> 15, 16.</note> is another of his Passages, in which he examines, what need the Man tell us, that these Fathers have endeavour'd by their Tears to cure the unfortunate Princes Wounds? Do's our Author, says he, venture to put them in a new Fright
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36597:36"/> of the Mob? On the same File, we may place a discovery that we Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest after the Kings Pardon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 23.</note> when in the Page foregoing, he allows we Addrest, when the Pardon was only in intention. These with many other Articles are, I confess, unanswerable; at least they will bear no other Reply, then that they are inconsistent: Nor indeed, do I hold my self obliged to answer all our Examiners Flights, and therefore shall dance attendance no further after him in his Extravagant Maze, through which he is hurried by the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> of a giddy Fury: But I leave him to beat the Air by himself.</p>
               <p>And, now let our Author be as scurrilous as he please, let him steep his Pen in the <hi>Asphaltites</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and drench it in the Vinegar and Gaul of the accursed <hi>Jews;</hi> let him Examine, Reflect, Traduce, with his utmost Skil, it is my comfort, that I suffer not without the company of most Celebrated Men. He that can represent not only our Grand-jury of <hi>Gloucester-shire,</hi> but the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and our best Doctors as Ridiculous, for Signing an Address in favour of our Established Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He that can Rail at our sincere inclination to King <hi>William,</hi> for affirming that <hi>English</hi> Bishops ought to be serviceable to him. He that can say, it is <hi>Monkery</hi> in a Prelate to be Seraphical, and to imitate the Purity of Angels. He that can pronounce, that for a Non-juror to be destitute of Pride, Prejudice and Passion, is to teach the World how to give him uncharitable Names: He that can enquire, whether any thing can be said worse of the Bishops, then that they mourn in Spirit for the Miseries of Protestants: He that can demand, where we Learn'd that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Expression of Holy Bishops and of Holy Tears: He that can maintain, that glorious Exploits become not Bishops, and that gallantry is a word too material for the Sons of Peace: He that can call one of the great Doctrines of the Church an old Tool, and can speak in favour of those, who explode the Practice of the best Christians, and the Language of the Gospel: He that can thus Blaspheme God, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel good Men, and do the Work of the Devil, to traduce the Brethren; let him assume the Title of a Clergyman, with what pretence he please: We may justly conclude, since a Tree is known by his Fruits, that he is neither the greatest of Saints, nor the least of Sinners, and, I am sorry, he should take occasion from any Juvenile Impertinencies, or Incongruities in the Apology, thus to Publish his own mistakes altogether inconsistent, as with the Religion we profess, so with the gravity of a Divine.</p>
